So next thing you know, got Roy Jones got involved and other fighters, Holyfield got involved, and then it turned into a fiasco. And then the young guy, Jake Paul. Yeah, Jake Paul, he got involved in. And that's how he. That's how the birth of Jake Paul became.\n",

            "Speaker B: Let me know how I found out. This gentleman, he was a mayor in this town in the midwest, and I talked to him before, and he was one of those stern guys. You always got the bills paid, always got your lights on. He always got everything right and perfect, but he didn't have a good personality. And he almost lost to a guy that didn't do anything. He didn't make. He shitted on people's tactics. He messed it, but he hung out with the people. He smoked cigarettes with him, he drank with him, he ate with him. He hang on the porch with him. And that's when you learn you can't take yourself too serious. You know what I mean? The world will turn on you if you take yourself too serious. Who the hell am I to take myself too serious? Made all this money, got this reputation, and now I'm looking at people. Screw facing them now. Have a great life. How am I gonna be mad at somebody? Really think about it. When my ego is not involved, how can I really be mad at somebody?\n",
            "Speaker A: That's beautiful. That's a beautiful attitude. And you're so right because there's so many people that are so concentrating on. They're concentrating so much on succeeding and doing great things.\n",

You have to be able to write poetry. He felt like if you had any imbalance, like, if you were, like, too aggressive or too peaceful, like, any imbalance was dangerous. He's like, you had to be, like, perfectly centered. So you had to be a person who understood all things.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's true. But everybody can't express themselves being centered. People have to be totally insane to express themselves or totally introverted to express themselves. And I don't know why it's like that.\n",

I mean, it's just when you're a guy who's in a position like you were in when you were 20 years old, like, I've had this conversation with many people. Do you understand the kind of self control it would take to be the baddest man on the planet? And you're only 20.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. It takes a lot of self control.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's crazy. It's a crazy position to be in control. So, like, imbalance at that point in your life was almost impossible. Like, to be like a multiple.\n",
            "Speaker B: It wasn't no balance. It was strict fighting. No girls, just strict. It's too much. This. That was bad. Oh, God. Fuck. I can't make that happen again. I got spawned. Do better tomorrow. That was bad. Okay, I gotta move my head. I got hit today. I got a black guy. Oh, God. Custer's gonna be mad at me if he see me do this, if he see me get hit. It was just. Everything was being perfect.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you think that that's what it takes to make someone who is as good as you, as young as you, you have to be completely obsessed.\n",
            "Speaker B: Me, Mike Tyson, I'm an obsessed mentality type of person.\n",
            "Speaker A: And at that point in time, I mean, to achieve what you achieved so quickly, too, you know, like, you met cuss when you were like, what, 1312? So from twelve to 20. I mean, that's wild.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's a wild twelve to 19. He died when I was 19. But the fact is that I put so much of myself into baklava, my emotions and everything. That was magnificent. That was great. But then when I came to life, it was disastrous. Right? Imagine being the guy that's just so, boom. Always in the person saying, hey, hey, guess what. Hey, baby, I love you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Hey.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, what's this? Hey.\n",
            "Speaker A: Hey, what's this?\n",
            "Speaker B: And I'm just that manic type of person with everything. Yeah, yeah. I love you. But he gonna stop talking. Hey, what I do? Hey, stop talking. I'm sorry. No, no, no. I will do it again.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, man. Oh, you know Neil Brennan? Neil Brennan, the comedian? Very funny comedian. But he has a funny joke about football players. Football players are getting violent altercations. He goes, he just did football outside of football. That's all it is. He gets paid to do football. Like, dudes who, like, crash into people on a regular basis and tackle people. Like, he's getting paid to do that. He just did football when it wasn't, you know.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, he did it illegally.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yes, he did it illegally.\n",
            "Speaker B: He did football when it wasn't time to do football. I did boxing when it wasn't time to do boxing, when it was out of season.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, it was out of season.\n",
            "Speaker B: Sometimes we do our sports when it's out of season and we get in trouble.\n",
            "Speaker A: But those things added to your mystique. Like when you got in that fight with Mitch blood green in some. Was it dapper dash, dapper Dan? Yeah, Dapper Dan's. And that was, like, that added to your mystique. Like when you crashed your car, gave it to the cops. Like, that added to your mystique. It was just wild, impulsive shit. But it's like, almost like that's what people want from the greatest boxer on the planet. You know what I mean?\n",
            "Speaker B: No.\n",
            "Speaker A: They want just chaos. It's part of the fun ride.\n",
            "Speaker B: I was a nobody that wanted to be somebody so bad.\n",
            "Speaker A: I.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what it was.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, but you. And you were quickly, and did you have a. I mean, obviously, you were supremely confident, but did you ever have moments where you couldn't even believe it was real?\n",
            "Speaker B: Um, right now, I'm waiting for somebody to say, get up, nigga, and go back to that cell right there.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God.\n",
            "Speaker B: Ain't that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. There's no getting used to some things. There's just no getting used to it, you know?\n",
            "Speaker B: But how do you get used to really. How do you really get used to understanding yourself when a Wayne tells you you're the greatest, right? That's what the gentleman was talking about, the five rings. How do you acknowledge yourself?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, he wanted. I mean, you obviously were the greatest, but there's like, almost like a samurai way of looking at it, where you acknowledge it, but you don't think about it, you know? And I don't know. I don't know who the fuck is capable of doing that. No one's capable of doing that at 20.\n",
            "Speaker B: In order to be in a master, you have to be the idiot first, right? You can't be the master without being an idiot. You can't be a master and become a master. You have to make the mistakes to become a master.\n",
            "Speaker A: 100%. You have to be a fool. If you're not a fool, you're not learning.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hell, you have to be a fool. You have to be a fool to even think you want to reach that level. Yeah, you have to be a fool.\n",
            "Speaker A: And, you know, it's a funny thing, because a lot of people are scared of trying anything new, skiing, anything, anything. They never did ice skating. People are afraid because you think about the early times when you were learning something, you're fucking terrible. At it. There's nothing more terrifying than being terrible at fighting. And you're learning fighting around people that are really good at it. And if you enter into that relic, you have to be a really courageous person to be a beginner in fighting.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, you always benefit from fighting because people who don't fight well teach people to fight well. That's normally how it goes. You never see no great legendary fighter being a great trainer. Very, very. It's probably 1% like a man, you know, 100%.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's a good example.\n",
            "Speaker B: Right, exactly.\n",
            "Speaker A: Emmanuel Stewart is not a guy that people knew as like a great heavyweight fighter, but my God, what a fucking trainer he was.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what happened. When you don't fight, you can teach in everything.\n",
            "Speaker A: There's some guys that are. But, like, Freddie Roach was a good fighter and Freddie Roach is an amazing coach. There's exceptions, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: They're very 1% though, right? So small.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's interesting, like, everybody has their role, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: What do you think? What do you think of these fighters like me? Don't you think we have a little bit too much self centered to really get involved with somebody? Yeah, it's totally, if they don't pick it up quickly, you know, we lose our interest because they think it should be like us or they should be that dedicated like us. They should stop fucking eating, losing weight when they don't need to lose weight. Right, right.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I could imagine that it would be just. You wouldn't be interested. Cause you're still working. It's not like a great man who is a great fighter at one point in his time, stops thinking about himself. You're always working on yourself, constantly.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, if you know who you are at this stage of your life, then you're very limited, right? If I know who I am at this day, we're 55 years old, and I know who I am, who I'm never gonna. This is never gonna change. This is who I am right now. I'm gonna be a very limited person.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, every day of our life, we change without even knowing.\n",
            "Speaker A: Absolutely.\n",
            "Speaker B: Without even knowing, we change.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's at every age, right? That's at twelve, that's at 35.\n",
            "Speaker B: I noticed the older I get, the closer I am to my past. I start meeting people when I was seven years old, eight years old now after. Now that I'm 55, I became world champion. They won 25 of them, 50 Grammys or platinum albums or something. And we just went on a different world. But we came from that little, that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Brilliant little cesspool also, they probably also can relate to you. Cause they can't believe their life is real, either.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, they tell me that, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, everybody says that. They all say they have, like, imposter syndrome.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Except Dave Chappelle. I think Dave Chappelle is just supposed to be here. Dave Chappelle doesn't have any, like, before shows. He's the coolest cucumber I've ever seen before a show. He just is relaxed. Just relaxed. Listening to, like, Nina Simone music, and then he just goes out and does his thing.\n",
            "Speaker B: Everyone. I don't care who you are. Everyone. Focus on who they are.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know, everyone does.\n",
            "Speaker B: We're all we have to think about what you think about. We are all we really have to think about besides our children. And even though we have children, we're a center of our attention.\n",
            "Speaker A: And the great coaches find those people and make them better.\n",
            "Speaker B: Exactly. You have to bring it out of them.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, but you have to have one of those people, you know, like, no.\n",
            "Speaker B: One could ignite me. Like customato. Right. It's totally different. You couldn't. It's just different. It was so emotional, involved.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you think it would be possible if you met a young man that reminded you of yourself when you were his age and that would excite you to train him? Like, if he was so excited about it and so dedicated and driven and talented, and you. You felt like he would do everything you told him to do and he would listen to you?\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen. You know how special you have to be to be a trainer?\n",
            "Speaker A: That's what I'm saying.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't care how great you are as a fighter. I don't care how great you are as a skier. You know how great you have to be to be a trainer? You have to be. It takes more to be a great trainer than to be a great fighter.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you think it's cause a great trainer has to be able to teach all kinds of styles?\n",
            "Speaker B: No, a great fit. Styles have nothing to do with the morale behind the style.\n",
            "Speaker A: The morale behind the style.\n",
            "Speaker B: But, you know, imagine you have the greatest guy, but I have the great determination and, you know, mean spire.\n",
            "Speaker A: You. Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Go be nothing.\n",
            "Speaker A: So, like, when you have a relationship like yours with cuss when you're 13 years old, I mean, that's the magic relationship in boxing, when people talk about the mentor, your mentors are everything. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Your job is to make your mentor happy, right. You know, if you do that, you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Accomplish your job the way you did it, man. It's like, it's one of those stories, like a movie story, it really is. It's like if you saw your life, if your life wasn't a real life and somebody wrote it in a movie, I'd be like, ah, a little too much.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, they don't know. They don't know how mean we are. We're mean. We were mean, baby. We wanted that belt.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. And it's also the. Just being so fortunate to have met a guy like cuss. Incredible, incredible. Just the stars align for you, you know? And that's what we all need to realize, that they don't align for everybody.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, because it was written.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Life is, everything's been written since the beginning of time.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you think that everything's been written like it all has a purpose to it? It's all going. Moving towards a certain.\n",
            "Speaker B: Absolutely, absolutely.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you see that? Like when you get really high too, like that's what I, when I, when I get do mushrooms or anytime I do anything psychedelic, I have this weird thought that all of this is like playing out towards a very predetermined outcome.\n",
            "Speaker B: Exactly. All of this is what we're doing now, me and you and everybody, is a beautiful process of dying. Once you're born, the process begin. Yeah, and that's what it is.\n",
            "Speaker A: And you are dying as the world is changing rapidly around you, as more people have access to.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, by you dying. By you dying, you change the world.\n",
            "Speaker A: That too. By you living, you change the world.\n",
            "Speaker B: Exactly.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that's the thing.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's like, I think death got a bad rap, I think. No, it has a bad rap. If life is beautiful, how could death be bad?\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, it's inevitable.\n",
            "Speaker B: Without life, there wouldn't be death. Without death there wouldn't be life. How could they both be bad? You think God would want us to be born and be scared about dying? That's all we're born now, we're scared to die.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, we want to stay alive, but we can't be scared of something that's inevitable, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: We could be afraid, but we just can't cling to life. It's not. And God wants us to be afraid. He just don't want us to think after this is nothing.\n",
            "Speaker A: It always.\n",
            "Speaker B: I would like to think that he would think that we would believe after this. There's more than this. I believe once you die, you begin to live. That's my theory on dying.\n",
            "Speaker A: It certainly could be that. And that sound like you tell that to like a pragmatic scientist. They'll act like we're crazy. But I think that if you have a psychedelic experience, one of the things you say to yourself is, okay, what is this? Tell us, how is this even real?\n",
            "Speaker B: Have a scientist tell us. The best science in the world. Explain your existence. Ask him to explain his existence.\n",
            "Speaker A: Explain your existence after you've done DMT.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, really explain your existence now.\n",
            "Speaker A: Explain your existence.\n",
            "Speaker B: He can't.\n",
            "Speaker A: You can live in the threshold of your birth to death, life and just operate by society's rules and only think about the things that matter to, you know, to your, your bottom line, your bank account and things like that. But you're missing out on.\n",
            "Speaker B: I just don't believe that. I think your consciousness tell you, you may not follow your consciousness, you may be afraid to react, but I think your conscience tell you, and you're just intimidated to move or react. I'm just totally different.\n",
            "Speaker A: Ignore it.\n",
            "Speaker B: Anything that I'm afraid to do, I do it. Anything I'm afraid to do, to ask the most prettiest girl in the world, I do this. I work for this position in life. Anything I'm afraid to do, I just do it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: And not afraid of the result. Well, I'm afraid of results, but I act as if I'm not.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that's. That's a great way to live your life. If you could just find things that challenge you all the time, find things that scare you all the time and do them as often as possible.\n",
            "Speaker B: And when you realize it, really, not many really think about it, really losing your children and death after that. What was really scary.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, most of it. You get overdose.\n",
            "Speaker B: Absolutely. And then you're just a part of this whole system that leads up to people and what led up to this, to me. And we'll let up to you, our generation now, our generation will lead up to something else.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. We're gonna lead up to a totally new kind of human being.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Grow a different Internet.\n",
            "Speaker B: It'll be a different human being and.\n",
            "Speaker A: Maybe a different species eventually, I think.\n",
            "Speaker B: So maybe we'll become a different species. It's too much. It's just too much scientific science out there that people are dibbling and dabbling in. All of a sudden they start seeing these animals that look deformed with human beings hands and heads and stuff.\n",
            "Speaker A: They've made human monkey chimeras. That means they've combined the DNA of human and a monkey. No, we're talking about how they did this. I think they only did it in the embryonics. Like, I don't think they actually raised one to a full grown living animal.\n",
            "Speaker B: And the monkey arms like this.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: It goes right here. Instead of going here, his muscles go right here.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. There's a video that someone sent me of a monkey shade pulling this dude's head off. Oh, yeah, pulling this dude's, like, scalp off. His head just jumps on top of this dude, bites into his head and peels back.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, it's a chimpanzee.\n",
            "Speaker A: No, it's a tiny little monkey. That's what's crazy. Here, I'll send it to Jamie. Cause it's a tiny little monkey, and the dude is in India, and you got it. Okay, so this dude is in India. This is it. Check this out. This is crazy. So the dude, the dude is like, thinks he's being friendly with this monkey. The monkey's sitting in his lap and the monkey just grabs him out of nowhere.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at this. Don't do this to me, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: Watch this.\n",
            "Speaker B: Don't do this to me, bro.\n",
            "Speaker A: He bit his head, his fucking scalp off.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yo, listen, man, that's just a little monkey.\n",
            "Speaker A: Not even a big monkey.\n",
            "Speaker B: You ever watch the chimpanzees when they hunt those monkeys? And they hunt them and then they just rip them, breaks them while they're alive, eating their hands, and then they're really considerate. They break off one hand and feed it till they get to the other monkey.\n",
            "Speaker A: They share, share parts of the monkey while they're eating, and they're alive.\n",
            "Speaker B: You saw that?\n",
            "Speaker A: It's screaming.\n",
            "Speaker B: I'm one of those guys that get into stuff like that, you know?\n",
            "Speaker A: Mike, they didn't even know about that until the nineties. They didn't know that they regularly hunted monkeys. They thought they lived off of fruits and vegetables, like gorillas. Gorillas just eat plants. It's crazy the way they do.\n",
            "Speaker B: If a gorilla's hungry, he'll eat meat.\n",
            "Speaker A: I bet he will. But they most of the time are just eating plants, whereas the chimps really like eating monkeys. It's just something about a little face when the chimp is grabbing it and pulling it apart, and the little face.\n",
            "Speaker B: Is like, no, listen. It's the power of being in control.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, it's just horrific to watch a monkey get eaten by a chimp.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, but the real deal is that's who we are. We're taught to be human beings. We're animals taught to be human beings. And just like some animals, some are more intelligent, some learn faster than others. That's why some of us are still in the animal stage of life, right? And we'll never change.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that process is going somewhere, right? Like it's going towards some very peaceful time. But I think that's one of the things that people love so much about violence and conflict. Even watching stuff like that, it reminds us. It excites us. Cause it reminds us, oh, we're just animals. We're animals too.\n",
            "Speaker B: Taught to be human. But also it reminds us not to be the. Not to be the weak one.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, don't be that dude. That monk is climbing on you. It's punking you.\n",
            "Speaker B: You're the one. Listen. Look at that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh Jesus.\n",
            "Speaker B: Mean chimpanzee. Look how evil that chimpanzee is.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh my God. That is a crazy photo.\n",
            "Speaker B: They're so powerful too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, insanely powerful.\n",
            "Speaker B: You can rip your face right off.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you know about the giant chimps that they found in the Congo? Do you know about this?\n",
            "Speaker B: Let's check them out.\n",
            "Speaker A: There's a group of chimps that they found in the Congo that are a subspecies.\n",
            "Speaker B: Let's check them out.\n",
            "Speaker A: They have. Yeah, they're called the bondo ape. There's a guy named Karl Armand. He's a swiss wildlife photographer or maybe he's from Sweden. And this dude has been. He sets up these camera traps in the Congo to try to capture them, to try to get photos of them because they're a rare subspecies of chimp that grows like 6ft tall. They weigh over 300 pounds.\n",
            "Speaker B: They're fucking huge. Maybe somebody's been a scientist in a laboratory with them.\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't think so. I think there used to be a bunch of different primates. Maybe if you died off.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at some people. There's been these animals that they found. It looks like it got teeth but it looks like a fish and it got clown.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's just a. I guarantee they fucked with some animals and made some hybrid animals. They definitely have done that. Chimp. This is in such a remote part of the congo it's so difficult to get there. And there's all these civil wars in that area. It's very dangerous to get through there.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, they get anywhere. You don't think when we driving by you see nothing but mountains and no green. You don't think there's people under those mountains or some kind like this. Like this?\n",
            "Speaker A: Do it. A laboratory. So that's, that's. Oh no, that's that chimpanzee.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's the evil one in the world.\n",
            "Speaker A: Isn't that the one that looks like a humanity? I think we're looking at most evil.\n",
            "Speaker C: That one's done here, it's that one.\n",
            "Speaker A: With, the guys are taking the photograph with it. The dead one, that's legit. They shot this one at an airport in the Congo. And it's fucking huge. I mean, you look at the size of those guys. It's, it's bigger than them and it's a chimp. And so they called this one, they called them, they had two different names for chimps.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's watch right there. Right?\n",
            "Speaker A: They had two different words for chimps. One was tree beaters and the other one was lion killers. That photo where they're holding that one up, that's another one. I mean, that's a giant fucking chimpanzee. It's way bigger than normal. And one of the things about them is they have these crests down there, the top of their skull, like a mohawk that gorillas have. But chimps don't normally have that. So they're an odd, that's why you.\n",
            "Speaker B: Call them a subspecies.\n",
            "Speaker A: And there's not that many of them. They're in this one area of the Congo. It's really interesting.\n",
            "Speaker B: I just think at the beginning we were a different species of people.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yes.\n",
            "Speaker B: As you see, during the period when we see these people that. What do you call them, the people that do all the digging?\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Anthropologists, archaeologists, and I seen them. And in one particular, it was about Amazons. And one picture they had this one Amazon. She must have been the queen because she, she was like this and she had a man in her feet. Oh, shit. He was dead and she was on top of him.\n",
            "Speaker A: That was how she died. That's how they buried her.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. In Russia, Ukraine, somewhere.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's heavy.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's a lady that needs a lot of attention.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, but a bunch of them. Listen, they have statues of men fighting the Amazon. They got guys grabbing them by the head. Wow. Women fighting them back, cutting, you know, jumping on men. They got statues of it. Amazon's fighting.\n",
            "Speaker A: There's all kinds of people out there. Imagine if that's a real thing. If there's like, it was a real tribe of super women.\n",
            "Speaker B: You didn't believe that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Fighters.\n",
            "Speaker B: You think it's fairy tale?\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't think it's a fairy tale, no. I just don't know anything about it.\n",
            "Speaker B: Real thing, baby.\n",
            "Speaker A: Real thing.\n",
            "Speaker B: Real deal, baby.\n",
            "Speaker A: So Amazon women, like a tribal group.\n",
            "Speaker B: Of women they got the right breath for. They can shoot.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's all real. Do you know about this, j?\n",
            "Speaker B: They found them buried.\n",
            "Speaker A: I believe it. They remove the right tit so they can shoot.\n",
            "Speaker B: Ow. And they enslave their babies.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, God damn. That's crazy to do. If that's true, that is one of the wildest things a person's ever done. For combat, remove part of your body so you can shoot a bow better. Makes sense, though.\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, you know, they did. They had the hairstyle engage, right? They elongate their head.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know why that doesn't make sense? Because if you're shooting a bow, right, your. Your tit shouldn't even come into play.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, listen, that's back then. They made. Shot it differently then.\n",
            "Speaker A: Maybe.\n",
            "Speaker B: I believe that, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker C: This is a myth.\n",
            "Speaker B: Myth.\n",

            "Speaker A: It's. It's a myth.\n",
            "Speaker C: Yeah, it says it's a fake fact.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, I was just thinking about. Because I shoot bows and arrows. I do archery. And when you use proper technique, the. The boobs don't even come into play. The string goes from here to here. Yeah, but you're pulling this back.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't believe anything during this. They had different science then they had now.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's true. They might have had different bows. Maybe they just realized they could hold the bow better and not have to chop a table.\n",
            "Speaker B: Maybe they have different gods and they believe different things, you know? Sure, most religion was superstition before it became religion. Yeah, religion was superstition.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, for sure.\n",
            "Speaker B: And most of us, we still are superstitious.\n",

            "Speaker B: And our religion, superstition, is bullcrap. But we're more superstitious than we are religious.\n",
            "Speaker A: You think so? Some people are pretty religious.\n",
            "Speaker B: Some people believe, oh, that black cat crossed the path. Oh, no. You believe that people believe the superstition.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you ever imagine what it would be like to live in a different time when there was no written history? And what those people must have been like, just passing down knowledge, listening, just talking to each other before they figured out how to write.\n",
            "Speaker B: Those are the greatest people of the beginning of the world. Those people. They gave us thought. They gave us the biggest freedom that we could ever have in our life. They gave us thought.\n",
            "Speaker A: Imagine we're still quoting them. You know, we're still quoting Aristotle. We're still quoting Sakura.\n",
            "Speaker B: We're still quoting all these guys.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, we're still quoting Genghis Khan. We're quoting people from thousands of years ago.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's pretty wild, because no matter how sophisticated we become, power's everything.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: We don't quote them because they had great quotes. We quote them, quote them because they were powerful men that had great quotes.\n",
            "Speaker A: There's that. And there's also just geniuses like Galileo. Imagine hanging out with that dude.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, listen, these guys are not cool hanging out with. Listen, all these geniuses, we like to be friends with them, but we don't want to live with them.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's probably true, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, we don't want to live with these genius friends of ours. Oh, they got so many habits. Oh, what the fuck, nigga?\n",
            "Speaker A: Fucking. Goddamn, though. You need them.\n",
            "Speaker B: You need those geniuses you like, nigga, you washing again? Some people just wash all day.\n",
            "Speaker A: All day.\n",
            "Speaker B: They take three showers. Every time he goes, I have a friend. Every time he takes a shit, he takes a shower.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: Every time he takes a shit, he takes a shower. Why? Took a shit. Every time he takes a shower, he takes the shower.\n",

            "Speaker B: I leave him. Next time they tell me he goes, I just leave. What the fuck? You go to the bathroom, how long you gotta take a shower? How does it take for him? I just don't want to do it, man. I don't know. How long you gotta take a shit, then you gotta take a shower. What the fuck? Fuck out of here.\n",
            "Speaker A: Imagine buddy goes to use your bathroom. Where's your towels?\n",

            "Speaker B: Yeah, sick people.\n",
            "Speaker A: Like, imagine just being around Galileo, and he's trying to tell you, hey, man, all this shit they think about where the earth is and the sun is, they're all wrong. Everybody's wrong.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, he was getting high with some people. There's no doubt.\n",
            "Speaker A: No doubt.\n",

            "Speaker B: I love the burning bush.\n",

            "Speaker B: I forgot that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Have you read. There's a great audiobook that I listen to called the immortality key. And I had a guy on the podcast who wrote the book immortal code. No, the immortality key is all about psychedelics and ancient religions, and it's. He's got. They've opened up a field of study at Harvard. So they're studying this at Harvard now. All the ancient Greeks they were all tripping. Yeah, that's what they were doing. They have evidence now, Mike. They found these ancient pots they used for their ceremonies. And there's an lsd reserves.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know Alexander the Great, when he went to ask. No, listen. He fell in love with the afghan people. When he went there. He got fucked up. Oh, I love you guys. Your guys. And that's what he said. Your guys are so beautiful. God made your guy so beautiful. God, all of his men, he's like every. He's one of his men that got killed. Next thing you know, they got Afghani and generals. They say, we supposed to rule these people? Why we got these guys, our generals. He fell in love with them. They got him high off the hash and all that. They fell in love with him.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow, that makes sense. It really does.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's why you see, you see the Afghanistan got that bushy hair. That's how Alexander, his men, the Greeks back then, they were mixed back then, the Greeks. So they had the bushy hair, too. You look at Greeks now, they don't have the bushy hair like they had back then. They were like wood of mountain men.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, we know the Vikings took a lot of mushrooms. We know that.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, the vikings are just getting high on anything. Blood, bones, whatever, man. The Vikings. That was an interesting. Yeah, that was interesting. There's nothing, you know, nothing like that. You think they're not savages. They're just great fighters, but they live a very respectable life. Healthy life, great culture.\n",
            "Speaker A: Great. There's a strong culture, like a fierce warrior culture. And then those people, like, populated places like Iceland.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know, but listen, those guys, those vicious savages, those guys are farmers. Look at these vikings. They're marauders. These guys are farmers. They're just farmers that know how to fight.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, after a while, they did kind of become farmers. Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. Well, more than fighting, you gotta eat, right?\n",
            "Speaker A: You gotta set up your civilization.\n",
            "Speaker B: You gotta sanitize the civilization.\n",
            "Speaker A: There was that. What is that show was on. It was on a and e or something like that. What was vikings on? Yeah, that was a good fucking show. I got into it with my wife for a while. We watched it for a few seasons, but she got tired of watching people get chopped up. A lot of people got chopped up.\n",
            "Speaker B: But they were doing it cause they were dying. They needed to stand.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, they also sacrificed people's lives and shit. Like they had human sacrifice. And in one of the episodes, it's like, whoa. And it's based all around what they really did. How the vikings really lived with some liberties.\n",
            "Speaker B: The Vikings became tsars. The Vikings became kings. The Vikings took over the world. They became african kings. Listen, there they became. They took over the world. Even in different cultures, even in the Chinese, the black culture, they have viking blood.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: Cause the western cultures. What was. The vandals went to Africa. They create vandalism. The vandals went to Africa.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's wild when you see all those people that live in Iceland and how fucking big they are. Like those giant strongmen guys. Most of them are from Iceland. It's like a large percentage of those strongest men in the world. Guys are all from Iceland. They're fucking huge up there.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's weird. And the cold, they get bigger than the heat. They get smaller.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's what deer do, too. It's a mammal thing.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. They got warm, so they stay more. Smaller.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, they. Well, it's. When it's hot out, it's easier to disperse the energy, like smaller bodies.\n",
            "Speaker B: If you see the siberian tiger and you see that, the indian tiger. Ooh. Totally different Siberians.\n",
            "Speaker A: Way bigger. Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Monsters.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Monks.\n",
            "Speaker A: Interesting. But them indian ones are mean as fuck. Those are mean as fuck.\n",
            "Speaker B: I think that the Siberians, they're so cold. They have to be mean. They're hungry all the time. They can fight. They can fight a polar bear.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's true, too. Wonder if which one eats people more. I bet it would be the indian one.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. Cause they know what happens, you know, in Siberia. You know how fucking much land they have out there in Siberia? That's ice. Before you can reach civilization in India, they keep infringing on their land. So they have one on one confrontation with the tiger in India. They keep approaching on his land, cutting down trees. He needs the big trees to hide, and they run right into.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Did you see the tiger on that thing when he jumped on the elephant? Elephant took the guy's fingers off.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: He looked so beautiful when he opened up the tiger.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right? Yeah. It's crazy that he knew that there was a person on top of that elephant, too. It wasn't just the elephant. He wanted to get the guy on top of the elephant.\n",
            "Speaker B: It was a tiger around, killing some bear, some cows and stuff. So they were looking for him, and they hit in the trees, and he came and went in the air.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: And I was on the elephant. Elephant's like 1011 foot tall.\n",
            "Speaker A: Imagine seeing that thing flying through in the air, trying to get you.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's like 700 pounds coming at you. Boom. That's how big they get. Oh, look at this. Here we go. Right here. Look at that. Look. That's more than ten pools.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God. That thing flew.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at this guy. Look at.\n",
            "Speaker A: You.\n",

            "Speaker B: Should be leaving. Yeah, he was eating that stuff. Those kind of.\n",
            "Speaker A: So he was eating cows and they were trying to kick him out of.\n",
            "Speaker B: The area and they came on these. I looked at orphans, like, ten foot tall, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: Could you imagine that job? Oh, you gotta keep the monsters out of the grass. Look at that mouth.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, my God.\n",
            "Speaker A: Look at that fucking mouth. Just looking to eat you, murder you and what?\n",
            "Speaker B: This guy just froze.\n",
            "Speaker A: He froze. There's this area of India called the Sundarbans, and it's this. This river where the water is not quite fresh and it's not quite. So it's all brackish. There's too much salt in the water. And they think it might be one of the reasons why the tigers are so aggressive there that they're constantly irritated. But the tigers in that area have killed some insane amount of people over the long run.\n",
            "Speaker B: Grab that lady out of the car.\n",

            "Speaker B: Whatever she get is gonna argue with a motherfucker. They get up, nigga. Get the fuck out. I don't wanna hear this shit out, all right.\n",
            "Speaker A: Could you imagine being with a woman who's so fucking crazy that she was. Yeah. You know, fucking park filled with tigers.\n",
            "Speaker B: I'm not gonna say anybody deserves that, but some people need to stop the bullshit, you know?\n",

            "Speaker B: Definitely one of my friends and my family member. You know, the relationship with tigers and stuff are different than lions and stuff. Lions are like dogs and stuff. They like hanging out with family, but tiger only hanging out with you. Oh, really? Yeah, only with you. And you hope. You better hope he doesn't like one of your children, because then you can't play with your children. He might kill you. Oh, my God, it's crazy. That's what the tigers are crazy. They get attached to one person. They're not getting no family people. One person.\n",
            "Speaker A: Whoa.\n",
            "Speaker B: They don't fuck around with a whole bunch of people. They're not like, mind hang out there on the front table, your table, hanging out with the family and stuff.\n",

            "Speaker B: They don't even wanna be seen. The only time they're with a female is when it's mating season. That's the mating season. If they see you, they're gonna kill you.\n",
            "Speaker A: I wonder why they have that coloration, that beautiful pattern on their body. I wonder if that's just. Cause it's so. When you see a tiger that looks. That's stunning. Like all the. I bet it makes you freeze more. Yeah, they're so stunning. Like, they look so.\n",
            "Speaker B: They look beautiful. When I was over a gentleman's house that had a tiger we were talking about, and I saw this cat. It's called a tabby. They're different than the stripe. They have, like, patches of orange. They're not stripes. They're patches on, like, cream color. And I was gonna hug the cat. He said, mike, don't hug the cat. Just go. Go down low. Because I was so pretty. I said, oh, my God. He said, no, Mike, don't touch it. And I forget it wasn't my cat. If it's not your cat, don't touch it. Yeah, if it's not your cat, don't touch it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Some cats will fuck you up.\n",
            "Speaker B: Ooh, yeah. Without knowing they hit you, they punch you. Just like, bow. Knock you cold. Yeah, knock you cold.\n",
            "Speaker A: But having a big cat for a.\n",
            "Speaker B: Pet, I just swim in the pool with them.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: They love swimming.\n",
            "Speaker A: So what did you do when you weren't around? Like, if you had to leave, you had to go to camp, if you had to do anything. Like, what did you do with the cats?\n",
            "Speaker B: They came with me.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really? They travel with you?\n",
            "Speaker B: I had 18 wheels. They have big trucks.\n",
            "Speaker A: Whoa.\n",
            "Speaker B: They live big, baby. I'm the heavyweight champ of the world. They live big. When I go somewhere, they go with me.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: Even if it takes days in the thing, I would have them expedite on the planes. Wow. I didn't care.\n",
            "Speaker A: So when you got to a place, like, say, if you were training, like, for a fight and you brought them with you, what would you do? Have a cage set up for them?\n",
            "Speaker B: I would have the trucks. I would always have the encampment already built at the house. But first thing, more and more, I would have my receipt for my tax. You know, you have to have. Every time they move, you have to have a license for them. If they move to Vegas. All right? We have to have the Vegas. Like, they moved to New York. We need a New York license.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right, right.\n",
            "Speaker B: And New York is so hard to get a life for live animals, you know, endangered species. So hard.\n",
            "Speaker A: There was a dude, they found alligator.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen. Alligator. No, no, that's not what happened. This is what they had in New York, right?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yes. In New York.\n",
            "Speaker B: Mm mm. He had an alligator in the bathtub and he had a tiger.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: And they started. Oh, this is stupid. Listen.\n",
            "Speaker A: Just listen to this.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen to. No, you have to listen. You gonna listen to this?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yes, please.\n",
            "Speaker B: He thought he was somebody's fault parent. The tiger and the lion started fighting. The tiger and the alligator started fighting. And he tried to break it up.\n",
            "Speaker A: Can you imagine?\n",
            "Speaker B: You had a ligator since you brought it up? Of course. You know, listen, how do you do that? In New York City? The tiger. The tiger's 400 pounds, man. Ain't no little tiger. And now little tiger. Remember the guy in the subway had a 500 pound tiger? He was the guy that lived in New York. In the subway. He had a 500 pound tiger.\n",
            "Speaker A: That is so crazy. Look at the size of that.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at this stuff. Look at New York police. Look, I told you, right? This is in his house, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: That is so crazy. That is.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, no.\n",
            "Speaker A: Look how big that thing is.\n",
            "Speaker B: Mandev. Joe.\n",
            "Speaker A: Look how big that is.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, Joe. My cat was a Joe. He was living with these kids. Look, that's. My cat's that big. But, Joe, look, we're living with these cats and they're not trained.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God.\n",
            "Speaker B: My cat is. My cat lives with me, sleeps in my bed. This cat. This cat's not. This is a wild cat, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God. Look at this.\n",
            "Speaker B: Wow. Hang out with this cat, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: They're so beautiful, though. Like, look at his face. Look at that face of that cat in the window with the copse.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at the 42 fake out, man.\n",
            "Speaker C: He's hanging, by the way. He's, like, floating in the air.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's looking at this cat.\n",
            "Speaker A: He's dropping down from the ceiling and he's seeing the cat. Oh, my God.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know. He's like, ain't this some bullshit?\n",
            "Speaker A: Look at that cat's face, though. Look how pretty they are.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, no, that's the fake out, man. They're pretty. That's how they get you to fucking stand still.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think that's what I'm saying. I think they're so beautiful. I think that might be it because they're colorations in the. I mean, it's not sneaky.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, but this is the thing, right? This is the thing I never understood about tigers. Right? They got someone, they don't want you to look at them.\n",
            "Speaker A: No, cats don't want you to look at them.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what all cats are like that. Yeah. The tigers don't want you to look at them. What's your fucking problem? You know, play with.\n",
            "Speaker A: Dogs have a problem with that, too sometimes.\n",
            "Speaker B: They don't make that face to face, though.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, they think you're challenging them.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what it is.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. They don't understand. That's why they don't know that they. When they love each other, this, like, sideways action. They, you know, they love on each other, but they don't, like, stare eye to eye to eyes. Like, I don't know what you're thinking. You might be challenging. Next thing you know, some dogs will do that if you eyeball them. That's why this.\n",
            "Speaker B: I never knew that. Since you said look in the face.\n",
            "Speaker A: They think you're challenging them for dominance. Like my golden retriever. You met my Marshall.\n",
            "Speaker B: When you see.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, we have pictures you cuddling with. But those are, like, the sweetest dogs. They don't challenge you ever. So he never like, really he looks me in the eyes. Just because we've known each other for so long, he knows it's not like a challenging thing that we're just being sweet to each other. But dog, even a dog like that doesn't like looking you in the eye. They like looking around your eyes, looking in the face.\n",
            "Speaker B: What's interesting about big cats, especially tigers, if a tiger, if you go like, I see my tigers in, and then I. Caveman, if I go and I see him, he's happy to see me. They run to the gate, I go in, I play with him, I bring him out with me. But if I go there and like this. Nah, the day to go in and it's looking at you, like, stare from.\n",
            "Speaker A: Eye to eye, he'll be like, when.\n",
            "Speaker B: They looking at you like this? And then I asked, looking at it. No, no, that's not a good day. Oh, no, don't go in there that day when they is looking at you.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's crazy that people love to have pets like that. They love it, like, to live in an apartment how much they had to feed it.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, and where's all the shit? They don't eat much, but they eat all day. Oh, they eat a little all day.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, they're so big, they. So he must be just giving it raw meat, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Chicken. Yeah, I chick. I like giving them chicken and I give them horse meat.\n",
            "Speaker A: Like you give them a whole chicken, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: I'm gonna get two or three of them, but then I give them the horse meat. This is when it gets fun, when you get the whole side of a cow or some horse, like this whole ribbon, you throw it in there and they slam and boom. And hit it against the fence and hit it in the air and grab it and then run inside like a joke.\n",
            "Speaker A: Did you ever see the video from the Iraqi Zoo when the us soldiers first took it over? Did you ever see that?\n",
            "Speaker B: No. No. He had their giraffes and all that stuff there.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, there was an iraqi zoo, and when the UF soldiers first got there, they would feed the lions. They would just let goats go. Just let them go and let the lions kill them. And everybody would watch.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, that's not good.\n",
            "Speaker A: But isn't that the way they're supposed to do it?\n",
            "Speaker B: No way.\n",
            "Speaker A: Because they'll get too into killing things.\n",
            "Speaker B: Why you eating them? Kissing. Okay.\n",
            "Speaker A: What is this?\n",
            "Speaker B: That's that guy.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, they made a movie about it. Oh, Jamie, send me this. Send me. Send me a link to this, please. I need to watch this document, dude. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't want to say things about.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's crazy. No fucking tiger at his house.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, listen. You listen. These animals make you believe that you can control them. They give you the. They give you the force, sense of security, that you're in control. They're smart. They know what they're doing. They say, oh, he really wants me to slay down with him and play with him. Oh, really? Oh, really? I'm gonna give him a fort. Let me see how he likes that. Or maybe I do a good dump in the bed. Let's see how he likes that.\n",
            "Speaker A: You really like me those shit right in your bed, nigga?\n",
            "Speaker B: No, but definitely. I never had that. But they farted. Fart. They might as well shit. Cause they fart. They might as well shit.\n",
            "Speaker A: How bad is a tiger fart?\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, man, listen, the house fucked up. All the windows gotta be open. You gotta permegate it. You gotta call some motherfuckers in, some guy, you know, they smoke in the house to clear the shit. What the fuck happened? They said, mike, what the fuck happened? Mike.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh my God. It makes sense.\n",
            "Speaker B: What the I man, it's gonna be Tiger farts.\n",
            "Speaker A: Make em leave. Oh shit.\n",

            "Speaker B: Listen, listen, you wouldn't, you have no idea, you would think that this is not real. This is not coming out of anything that breathe air. This didn't come out of something that breathes air. It's no fucking way, Joe. How did this. I can only imagine.\n",
            "Speaker A: I was talking to this dude who's a wildlife expert. He said one of the more distressing parts about the zoo is that people get to stare at animals because there's no other world where anything gets to stare, anything with eyes in the front of it's face.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, maybe you want to check. At one time in life they did experiment when they put people in the zoo.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: You want to check that one out of human zoo. The human zoo.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's a scary.\n",
            "Speaker B: And it was real people in there, they fucking in front of people, looking at them eating. And it was.\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't want to give people any ideas. I wouldn't want to have a human zoo because I wouldn't want people having any fucking ideas.\n",

I know people don't know, but listen, whatever you think, whatever you think a human did to another human being, it happened. Yes. Anything, I don't fuck, ate or whatever.\n",
            "Speaker A: It happened somewhere in history definitely happened. It probably happened somewhere this year.\n",
            "Speaker B: And sometimes in these special camps and stuff, it happens. These people, only thousands of acres and nothing grows on them, and just right.\n",
            "Speaker A: Weird ranches where people meet and do rituals.\n",
            "Speaker B: Might want to hunt a motherfucker. Let him go.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's not outside the realm of possibilities.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know, that's why I'm throwing it at you.\n",
            "Speaker A: I guarantee you there's been a someone, somewhere in the world who paid someone to hunt a person. I guarantee you that's not.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, no, this is what happened. They take these homeless people off the streets, put them in there, take them to one of these special hospitals, they take them from their hospitals, may have them drugged up, take them on these large estates of property. Let's hunt. Run nigga, run. No, really, I really believe that's been in. I really believe that.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think. Well that book, the most dangerous game, didn't that come out in like the thirties? It's an old, old book about that very, very thing. Rich people.\n",
            "Speaker B: The only reason we hunt the fuck. Why is the only reason we hunt fox?\n",
            "Speaker A: I think there's the fur.\n",
            "Speaker B: The fox is the only one that backs tracks.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, because it's sneaky.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's the only one that backs tracks. Like if he, if he chases, if you chasing, he'll go forward, then it come back with. And go this way to trick you. Yeah, that's, that's why that's the only really challenging. That's the only challenging chase. Everything else is too easy. It's too simple minded. The fox is the only one that's challenging.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, that's interesting. That makes sense. I never thought about it that way.\n",
            "Speaker B: And so now they say, well, the fox is the most reasonable animal. Let's try a human animal. See how reasonable he is.\n",
            "Speaker A: Guaranteed. Yeah, guaranteed. Someone's done that.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what they want, to challenge reasonability.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yes.\n",
            "Speaker B: Let's see how he thinks. How does he think? How is he superior than us? Why? We should be. They're not gonna do anything. They think that's inferior than them.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: They're gonna. They're gonna study what they're gonna attack or what they're gonna make their victim is for sure.\n",
            "Speaker A: People have done that, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Anything you think a human being could do, he did it to another human being.\n",
            "Speaker A: But that one, like an organized one like that, where they're hunting someone, for sure, that's happened.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, listen, I don't care. How much fun would that be? No, you think about it. You know, forget who's watching you and what people think about you. But how much fun would that be?\n",
            "Speaker A: Depends on who the guy is.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, that to imagine if he's smarter than you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, Jesus.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, and you can't catch him and he's smarter than you, and he kills you. You know? That's what it is. Don't they allow them to have some weapons and stuff and this kind of stuff? I heard they allowed them to have weapon.\n",
            "Speaker A: I'm sure there's different rules. I'm sure different people have different ways of doing it to make it more sporting.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I think it's not sporting when they're not fighting back. I don't care how much of a smoke you are, it's just not as much excitement as punches not coming at you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right. Maybe they give you like a set.\n",
            "Speaker B: Of tools, then they know you're gonna fail with. But it'd be interesting.\n",
            "Speaker A: At least you have a possibility of succeeding. Make it a little more exciting for them.\n",
            "Speaker B: It becomes exciting you know, it only becomes exciting when the rabbit got the gun. If the rabbit don't have the gun, trust me, it's just gonna be a shooting fish in a bucket.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Hunting a human being. Jesus Christ. What a terrifying thought that people would be into doing that. But if I had a guess, yes or no, I would say definitely people have done it.\n",
            "Speaker B: And there's got to be somebody with the egos that they got to kill me. They're going to go kill me. I'm going to survive this.\n",
            "Speaker A: Especially if you put up a big prize reward. You say you make $5 million. If you live, you make $5 million. No, I bet a lot of people.\n",
            "Speaker B: Would say that it has nothing to do with money. Just live or die. Your instance of your life, right?\n",
            "Speaker A: But I mean, how many people would risk it just to see if they could win money? Like, if you had a show like.\n",
            "Speaker B: That, were you so looking like this, say you were in poverty all your life. If, you know, you, if someone could take your heart right now, your heart, your parents, your family, be rich, right? What would you do?\n",
            "Speaker A: You might do it.\n",
            "Speaker B: Exactly. Surprised how selfish some people are, right?\n",
            "Speaker A: A lot of people will be like, no, I work this out on my own.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, no, take my family. Let's kill them.\n",
            "Speaker A: You wouldn't. I mean, it's one of those questions like, would you really believe them? You're gonna let them kill you? You believe they're gonna take care of your family? Are you sure?\n",
            "Speaker B: You move. Maybe you wanna believe it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. You wanna believe it? To end the suffering.\n",
            "Speaker B: A person will take care of your family. If you kill somebody you don't like. Later for. If you do something really spectacular, right? What does it really cost to take care of a family? You know?\n",
            "Speaker A: Depends on how you take care of him, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that's a. If you think that everything should be legal, that's where, you know, someone, a game show or someone tries to kill you, that's a fucked up legal.\n",

            "Speaker A: He's trying to make him a spy. He's just a guy who's got a creative mind. That was a great show, though. He was so silly. That was like. What was that, the seventies?\n",
            "Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. There's like one that says it was a 77.\n",
            "Speaker A: He was so silly. He was like a silly guy.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, it was this. Listen. These jewish guys. It was Rosenberg's. Remember these guys in world War two? The Rosenbergs. Esther Rosenberg.\n",
            "Speaker A: With other people that got electrocuted. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: My mentor cuts him out. He would put his life. They were innocent.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of people. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: He put his life on it. They were innocent. He got me in trouble. I'm telling everybody. I don't even know nothing about these Jews. They're innocent. They're innocent. Cause I'm just following him. Oh, man. You believe how many people hate these people? Yeah. Holy shit.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, they were probably innocent.\n",
            "Speaker B: The brother in law, the wife's brother, made everything up. He told the story. I don't know what he made of, but I grew up being taught they were innocent. Ain't that some bullshit?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, it is. What? So what do they think happened? How did they get in trouble? How did they get caught up in it?\n",
            "Speaker B: The brother, her brother, I believe, made something up, got suspicious about something that he's seen, and he reported it.\n",
            "Speaker A: And then they got arrested for it, and then they got executed for it. Right. But they didn't do anything. Right.\n",
            "Speaker B: So, you know, so they.\n",
            "Speaker A: Was that the story?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",

            "Speaker B: Or died.\n",
            "Speaker A: Or died, yeah. My God. I mean, that's one of the things about the future that I think is going to be very strange, is when we could read minds, because I don't think that's far off.\n",

            "Speaker B: Imagine if you can control that in some kind of capacity. You know, me, make that work in some kind of capacity. Do you understand?\n",
            "Speaker A: I think it was an emerging. It's an emerging part of being a.\n",
            "Speaker B: Person I ain't seen in ten years. A guy, man, I wonder this guy already. Hopefully it's still alive.\n",

            "Speaker B: There's no coincidence. It's all been written since the beginning of the light. It's been written. If you don't think so, it's just ridiculous to believe that.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think sometimes it could be a coincidence, but sometimes it's not. And I don't know why I know it's not. I don't. I don't. I don't know that it's not. But I know that there's moments where, like, I'm thinking of a very good friend, and then he calls me and I'm like, wow, it's weird. Like, I haven't talked to this guy in a while, and he's just calling me out of the blue, not even texting me. Every now and then you feel like there's a connection, you know, every now.\n",
            "Speaker B: And then I have dreams, but normally when I sleep, it's blacked out or white out, and then I wake up.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you not have dreams or do you not remember your dreams?\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't remember having a dreams. I snow blackouts.\n",
            "Speaker A: What is the difference between the days you have them and the days you don't? Is it like when you more rested, you have dreams? Or is it. Does it have anything to do with anything that goes on your life?\n",
            "Speaker B: I dream more when I'm awake than when I sleep.\n",

            "Speaker A: So when you sleep, you just go out?\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, yeah, I have more time to position myself, to relax, to meditate.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right, right, relax, yeah, yeah. When you made that shift and got back into fighting again, was that. What did it feel like to just all of a sudden go into, like, warrior mode again? I saw you doing road work. I saw you hitting the bag and working out with Rafael Cordero. I'm like, this is wild to see.\n",
            "Speaker B: It was nothing to me, but I was excited more because my friends were excited. Mikey, how's your back? Your back, all right, Mike, you move me your fucking back. I'm wondering if your fucking back, all right? And I said, mike, I can't believe you're doing this shit, Mike. I said, mike, you fucking crazy? You doing this shit? Fuck. You doing this shit, Mike. Fuck.\n",
            "Speaker A: It was crazy for all of us to watch.\n",
            "Speaker B: Mike, don't do this shit, man. And look, I love Dana, right? Dana White's my man. I don't care. I know I could. I can never say nothing bad about him. So he said, mike, I don't want you to fight, man. I'm gonna get you a job, make you some money. He gets me the goddamn shark week job. He gives me the job. I gotta put the shark asleep. Now, he doesn't want me to fight and get knocked out and beat up, but he wants me to go in there and put a shark to sleep.\n",
            "Speaker A: How the fuck do you put a shark to sleep?\n",
            "Speaker B: You rub his belly and he's real big. And now listen.\n",
            "Speaker A: What?\n",
            "Speaker B: So I got the shark. Like the nine foot. I got. I made him catatomic. He freaked out and just chilled, right? So the next day I have to do the tiger shark. The tiger shark is the most aggressive shark. He's amongst. Look, how big. How big is the tiger shark?\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God.\n",

            "Speaker A: I think a big one is like that.\n",
            "Speaker B: So they do. Excuse me, no race. They do this white shoe with me. They go, all right, Mike, so we got the tiger shark tomorrow, all right. He's more aggressive, of course. So you have to move differently with this guy. And he's gonna come at you, but when he comes, you go underneath the neck. When he tries to attack you, you go underneath, and your tickle is. So I'm in there, I'm saying, when this, I'm saying, listen. They're throwing blood in the water. Dead fish. The ocean is getting red out, man. It's a big bloody mess there. And listen, the tiger shark don't show up.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: No shark show up. The tiger shark, no shark showed up. I said, oh, God, thank you. The shark didn't show up. I said, what? Maybe he died. Altercation with a whale or something.\n",
            "Speaker A: But, God, imagine Dana white got you eaten. Listen, imagine it was Dana's fault, and you get eaten by a fucking shark.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, no, no. Oh, you want to hear this? No, no, no. Forget that. You want to hear this? My wife thought it was a good idea, too. I said, your motherfuckers don't care about me. They don't give a fuck about me, man. My wife said, that's a good idea.\n",
            "Speaker A: Telling her to get in the ocean with sharks and bloody fish and tickle them, tickle them under the chin. Wild sharks, these aren't transparent in the.\n",

            "Speaker A: So, Mike, what are you wearing? Chain mail? Is that like a chain mail suit or something like that? It's supposed to, like, something protect you?\n",
            "Speaker B: Joe, please. Look how stupid I look.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God. So you have this bite suit on? Is that what it is? Listen, did he bite you at all?\n",
            "Speaker B: No, right? But this is the thing. This is the real thing.\n",
            "Speaker A: This is so crazy. You're touching its face.\n",
            "Speaker B: This one thing has kept hitting me, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: This is crazy, Mike. This is so much more dangerous than boxing.\n",
            "Speaker B: No doubt. But my wife thought that Dana was doing me a favorite. My wife, he thought Dana was doing us a favor. He was helping our family out, make money without getting hurt.\n",

            "Speaker B: Listen, um, you have a bet. Yeah. You're more successful with a tiger. You scream.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: And he might freak out and run. Sometimes they do.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think they'd enjoy it. I think if you screamed at a tiger, I think you would think it's adorable.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know what I found out about tigers? Tigers are really, like wimps and stuff.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. If you step on the hand bite, they freak out. They're not gonna fight back.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: If you step on their feet, hit their feet, they freak out. Really freak out. Yeah. And know what else I found out about sharks, too?\n",
            "Speaker A: What?\n",
            "Speaker B: That stuff that we see on television. You get a chair, put a chair. Freaks them out. Oh, yeah, a chair freaks them out. Tigers do lions, too. Freaks them out. I don't know why, but a chair, like a wooden chair, four legs go like that. It freaks them out.\n",
            "Speaker A: Huh. I wonder why.\n",
            "Speaker B: Remember you see a cartoon, they had the whip in the chair.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's right. They always did.\n",
            "Speaker B: The chair freaks them out.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, well, that makes sense. Damn. I'm learning some shit on this podcast I did, too.\n",
            "Speaker B: Like when I saw them talking about what happened, then I saw the cheers. Freaked him out.\n",
            "Speaker A: That makes total sense. That was always the image of the guy who tamed the lion. He had a chair in his hand.\n",
            "Speaker B: Chair freaks them out.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow, what a strange animal.\n",
            "Speaker B: Know what's strange about a tiger? When he's just laying down, and then you come in the room and he's chilling, then you open your eyes and his eyes are at your eyes.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oof.\n",
            "Speaker B: And you like this. Hey, hey, hey. Everything cool? You know, you wake him up, you know, you can't leave. This is interesting. You can't leave a tiger. Lion's cool, but you can't leave a tiger like this too long, you know, looking. You told me that's challenging. Yeah, that's what it was. That's probably like, yeah, you can't do this too long with them. No, see, that's why when I look at him, he's like, hey, hey, hey.\n",
            "Speaker A: What a fucking gamble that is. What a gamble. It's basically living with a monster.\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, listen, it's difficult. Cause you get brainwashed because you raise them from a baby and then you reprimand them and they get in check and stuff like, yeah, okay, I'm in check. Yeah, you a again.\n",
            "Speaker A: Christ.\n",
            "Speaker B: But it's the toxication in your mind, the toxication that you're in control, right? That's the bullshit you're believing in. Bullshit, false sense of security. You're in control with this big cat. This cat's 500 pounds. You raise the sense of the baby, but you pisses him off sometimes. You piss the cat off sometimes. You get mad that he fought. You might smack him, he might get pissed off.\n",

            "Speaker B: That's a very interesting guy, Joe. Oh, hilarious, yo, listen, he has so much of a. One of those, what do you call those, guard complex, you know, got these guys in control. Listen, he had one of his workers sacrifice their arm and still go to work and say, hey, I'm working free of charge. That's that guard. Period. That's that guard mentality shit.

            "Speaker B: Beautiful ones too.\n",
            "Speaker A: So when you had four, did you have four at the same time or did you have four ones at different times?\n",

I think I'm a doctor, so I'm gonna give it that. I'm gonna give him a technician. Cause I don't want no one to know. I have this lion and tiger. So I have to. Have to be the doctor and I have to be the mother, the father, the doctor.\n",

            "Speaker B: I was in my delusional stage that I'm Mike Tyson. I'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet. These lions and tigers are gonna know it too, you know, and it didn't work out that way. It didn't come out the way I planned it. It really didn't. They acknowledged that I was inferior and they just bounce me. Listen, they bigger now. So the tiger and the lion are fighting and for some reason, I don't know, the tiger's bigger, but the lion is. The tiger's intimidated the lion a little, right? And he's big, like 200 pounds bigger. So the lion's chasing him. Right? So the lion's chasing the tiger and the wall is here. The lion goes right, the tiger goes right up the wall. Boom. The lion goes, boom, hits the wall and goes up, out.\n",

            "Speaker B: Yeah, 20 years, 20 pounds, what, 200 pounds heavier and he's more agile.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",

            "Speaker A: The thing about the male lions is they're just big to protect. They're big to protect and control the tribe. The females do all the hunting.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, they do all the fighting.\n",
            "Speaker A: Did you ever hear about that island where the river broke off into a different direction and made this area an island in Africa? And the lions that live there, all they have to eat is water buffalo. So they have lions and water buffalo. And these lions have grown bigger than regular lions. So the female lions that live there, they're as big as regular male lions. They're fucking huge because all they do is, I think it's called relentless enemies. And all they do is hunt these buffaloes. They're like super sized lions. So because it's a whole. Look how pride of lions, where the females are enormous because they have to take down.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at the muscles. Look at the stomach. That's how you can tell. Look at the stomach.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, they're fucking super Jack lions. Yeah. All they have to do is eat these giant ass buffalo which are impossible to take down and they could get killed easy.\n",
            "Speaker B: They kill lions as well.\n",
            "Speaker A: These buffaloes so the only ones that live.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at this guy.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. The only ones that lived were the ones who were the descendants of the animals that are strong enough to kill the buffalo. And so those are the ones that bred. And then within, you know, how many hundreds of years.\n",
            "Speaker B: Do you know? Well, just recently, normally, when the white lion is born, they normally kill it, let it starve to death. And one incident.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. One instance they found where they hunted for this white lion. You come out in brown and green with white. You can't. Everybody's gonna see you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right. So that's why the other lions kill it.\n",
            "Speaker B: They killed the. Fed him, help to help him eat. That never happened before.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: So ordinarily you think they would kill it because it's too visual.\n",
            "Speaker B: No. Yeah, give the tribe away. Yeah, give them. They were scared of it, too. It was always the omen. Even with tigers and lions, they see the white that scared. They killed it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Albino animals are we. I saw an albino.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's not albino, though.\n",

            "Speaker A: Yeah, because they're not living in the snowy area like a polar bear.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, but listen, that's where it stems from.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: For them. For those, they could hide the grass in the snow.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, right. For polar bears. Cats, too.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, they lost them from the coldest Siberia. Whatever. They also come from the white ones. Cause that's the. In the jungle you can see it, but in the snow you can't.\n",

            "Speaker A: Oh, really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, the little ones are tough. The big ones are more lovely dovey than the little ones. Look at that cat. Does that cat look like he wants to hug you and play with you? Look at the person's holding him. He don't look like he wants to be there. Look at him.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, no. What are the eyes in that fucking.\n",

            "Speaker A: No. Go to that picture again with the guy holding him.\n",
            "Speaker B: He just don't look cool, man. The guy's happy. This guy just don't look cool.\n",
            "Speaker A: He's a dork. He's gonna get clawed.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, this guy. This cat just don't look good, man. I never knew they were that big. Minds weren't that big. That's like a dog, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: Dude, the eyes. Look at that cat's eyes.\n",
            "Speaker B: See that thing's been eating. Somebody's been feeding that cat.\n",
            "Speaker A: Look at the look in his eyes, though. That is horrific.\n",
            "Speaker B: The little cats are tough. The big cats are easier than the little guy.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, it makes sense. They have to hustle. They have to be killing things all the time.\n",
            "Speaker B: All the time.\n",
            "Speaker A: Because they're eating rabbits and stuff.\n",
            "Speaker B: Look at one. Died and ate him.\n",
            "Speaker A: Hunt and devour lynx. Yeah, makes sense. Trying to wipe out the competition all the time. That's a hard life, being a small cat living in the wild, you know?\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, that's true, but they live longer because they eat less.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, right. They probably lived longer, too, because they just stay out of conflict.\n",
            "Speaker B: Just keep moving in. A lot of conflict. Believe it or not, during the day, they out a lot.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, wow, look at that one. Biting a deer.\n",
            "Speaker B: I never knew he could take a deer down.\n",

            "Speaker A: God damn. That's a fascinating subject. I love when we talked about that last time, Temujin. Oh, you know, Genghis Khan. Like, I love how fascinated you are in those ancient conquerors, those ancient historical figures. They're fascinating.\n",
            "Speaker B: All these guys want. The guys we thought they were. Alexander the Great was probably smaller than. Shorter than Napoleon. You hear these guys, you think they're big guys. These are little guys, right? The biggest guy is the guy from Russia, Peter the great. He's the biggest conqueror they ever been.\n",
            "Speaker A: How big was he?\n",
            "Speaker B: About six, seven, something like that.\n",

            "Speaker B: Listen, one of the. One of the mummies, I forgot one of them. They were. He was six five. You know, his. He had a real long skeleton. And then when you see the pyramids and you go in there, you have to. Around this big. No, you always gotta bend down. This is similar. Worshiping God.\n",
            "Speaker A: What do you think when you see the pyramids? What the fuck do you think happened there? How is that possible? How is it possible that someone could make something that big, that incredible, so many thousands of years ago?\n",
            "Speaker B: I believe humans can do anything. That's what I believe. I believe humans, with conviction, can do anything.\n",
            "Speaker A: I believe that, too. But, I mean, how. How the fuck did they do that?\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, listen, um, believe it or not, all that we accomplished, we really not that smart.\n",
            "Speaker A: Okay, well, definitely not me.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, um, you know the caves in France where they got the writing? Yeah, yeah, the paintings, right? That's in France. There's no lines in France. There's lines on the wall. But no, not only that. Say what? 40,000 years ago, lions didn't have mains. They wrote lines, but they didn't write them. They didn't paint the mains. Really? So 40,000 years ago, they didn't have mains. They painted what they saw. And 40,000 years ago, France was attached to Africa.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. It had to be in order to have lions in the cave in France. Did he write what he saw in Africa brought into this cave?\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, one thing I know for sure, Mike, is that a bunch of mammals died off. They think, around 12,000 years ago. They think at the end of the ice age, there was a big die.\n",
            "Speaker B: Off, a big cat.\n",
            "Speaker A: A lot of animals too big to survive.\n",

            "Speaker B: They were. The saber tooth.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, there was a saber tooth, too, but there was also another one that was an american lion. It was a huge lion that lived here in North America. There was a bunch of wild shit here. And even horses were wild here at one point in time. And then the Europeans brought them in again. What? They started here, apparently. This is from this. Dan Flores, what do you think about.\n",
            "Speaker B: Animals and humans breeding? You think that's possible?\n",
            "Speaker A: I think if it was, there would be a lot of, like, half sheep, half horse, half dog, people out there.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't know.\n",
            "Speaker A: Thank God we can't. I'm worried about scientists. That's what I'm worried about. I'm worried about scientists doing something to DNA and making something that's not a person anymore. Something that is like. Like if a scientist actually made a werewolf a thing that's part human, part wolf, and said, listen, why would we risk human lives in war if we've all committed to just ground on ground combat? Let's make werewolves and send them out to.\n",
            "Speaker B: Cause we're like big kids. Sometimes we don't like the outcome, right? Fuck that. I didn't lose. I didn't want to. Fuck you. I'm gonna let the fucking real bomb off now. Click. We're children.\n",
            "Speaker A: That scares the shit out of me. What? That someone could let the real bomb go off again.\n",
            "Speaker B: Why would you be scared about dying?\n",
            "Speaker A: It's not the dying part, it's the dying slowly part. The dying part's not scared.\n",
            "Speaker B: Dying is dying.\n",
            "Speaker A: Death is death. The real problem is the deterioration of all common decency and full chaos. No power, no food, no nothing. A lot of radiation poisoning. A lot of people dead from the initial blast, a lot of people dying from whatever's done to the water and the soil afterwards over the next 50 years.\n",
            "Speaker B: So what are we gonna do?\n",
            "Speaker A: Hopefully not blow each other up. Did you ever get to meet Putin?\n",
            "Speaker B: Um, no, I didn't meet Mister Putin, but I met, um, his. What was this guy name? He died. Come on. The guy with the. Gorbachev, he was the president. Mister Gorbachev, you met him? Wow. In Georgia or something. What was it? Georgia.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah, the country of Georgia.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, the country of Georgia. Whew. I hung around in Chetney. I hung around that place.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah, what's that like?\n",
            "Speaker B: Interesting. It's different than us. Yeah, it's totally different than we are. We live totally different than us.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's a different culture. And the history of that country is so brutal.\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, you know, in order for them to be brutal, they had to have a heavier, stronger power to intimidate them. The only way they could fight them is do. I don't know, what do they call that man to man combat? Use themselves as bombs and stuff like that. Why they go to fight Russia? How you gonna fight Moscow? You're a little small country like that. Chetnya and stuff, right? Remember they had the widows of the chetnian warriors, the ones that sacrificed their life for Chetnya. And they had the widows of them and they had kidnapped a bunch of people in the movie theater and they released some kind of gas to kill the chetnam warrior women. And they killed all the people in the movie theater too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Jesus.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. When was that up? Yeah, look that up, Chestnut.\n",
            "Speaker A: Rough fucking part of the world and.\n",
            "Speaker B: It always russian movie theater, Chetney and terrorists.\n",
            "Speaker A: So many fighters come out of Russia right now.\n",

            "Speaker A: So many killers.\n",

            "Speaker B: Check it out, check it out, check it out. Dude.\n",
            "Speaker A: So October 23, 2000. 250 chechen rebel storm a Moscow theater, taking up to 800 people hostage during sold out performance of a popular musical. The second act of the musical nord, or OsT, was just beginning in the Moscow ball bearing plant's palace of culture when an armed man walked on stage and fired a machine gun into the air. The terrorists, including a number of women with explosives strapped to their bodies, identified themselves as members of the chechen army. They had one demand, that russian military forces begin an immediate and complete withdrawal from Chechnya, the war torn region located north of the Caucasus mountains. Chechnya, with its predominantly muslim population, had long struggled to assert its independence. A disastrous two year war ended in 1996, but russian forces returned to the region just three years later after russian authorities blamed Chechens for a series of bombings in Russia. Wow. Okay. So it was a 57 hours standoff at this palace of cultures, during which two hostages were killed. Russian special forces surrounded and raided the theater on the morning of October 26. Later, it was revealed that they had pumped a powerful narcotic gas into the building, knocking nearly all of the terrorists and hostages unconscious before breaking into the walls and roof and entering through underground sewage tubs. Holy shit. Most of the guerrillas and 120 hostages were killed during the raid. Holy fuck.\n",
            "Speaker B: 120 hostages killed from the gas? Not from the gas. It's not from the bomb explosion.\n",
            "Speaker A: Jesus Christ. Say, only a complete surprises attack could have disarmed the terrorists before they had time to detonate their explosives. Wow. They had defended decision to use the gas.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's stupid, though. They killed all. They killed more people than the terrorists did.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow. Jesus fuck the christ. It's a hard part of the world, Mike. It's a hard part of the world. It's a hard part of the world.\n",
            "Speaker B: But when it's beautiful, it's beautiful.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, well, their architecture, like, look at my.\n",
            "Speaker B: I'm talking about the people.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, the people.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, yeah, the people are beautiful, incredible.\n",
            "Speaker A: Powerful people over there.\n",
            "Speaker B: And, hey, listen, they're the most humblest people in the world. You know, this kind. Oh, man, you just can't believe it, you know?\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't. People, I see this Ukraine tragedy happening on television, and I'm, you know, it's horrific and it's crazy and it's hard to watch. And you're like, like, why are we doing this in 2022? I can't believe a real war is breaking out like this again in a new place. But when we see it, one of the things that's blown me away is all these Ukraine fighters that have taken up arms, Lomachenko, the Klitschko brothers, Usyk, all these guys that are like huge superstars, they're putting on flak jackets and helmets and they're defending their country. It's wild to see.\n",
            "Speaker B: They benefit from that country just as right, should band up and fight for it.\n",
            "Speaker A: But do you? I mean, I don't imagine a world where that would be that common in America. Well, listen, I mean, unless we were, like, legitimately invaded.\n",
            "Speaker B: Started off. It started off as, um, I don't know, business war. I guess when Putin, he wanted whatever they possessed, and then people got involved, we got involved, and it turned into a war of humanity. It's warm business to walk to humanity. That's where I started for business. People wanting something. I don't know what it was that he wanted. I don't. Maybe. I don't know anything. But I just know normally war started because somebody wants something that you possess.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: And everybody got involved with it. So we put it. We made it a war. Pretty much being humanitarian, and I don't know, it's just everybody's jumping on the bandwagon, I think. I don't. I think it's just. I think people are jumping on the bandwagon.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know what it's made me aware of to how much military activity is going on all over the world at any given time.\n",
            "Speaker B: We don't know about magna third world countries where people are just eliminating other races of Muslim. One Muslim is just eliminating this race of Muslims.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: People using Kurds and whatever they are.\n",
            "Speaker A: Bombings.\n",

            "Speaker A: My friend Dave Smith is always talking about the bombing in yemenite, and he's like, do you know what a horrific genocide is taking place in Yemen? And he talks about these bombings. I'm like, well, try finding that in the news, man. You don't find anything like that in the news. But one of the days, in the early days of the russian Ukraine war, someone put a graph up that showed how many bombings occurred. Like, how many? I don't know what you would call it when a drone detonates a missile. Like, how many of those happened in other parts of the world?\n",
            "Speaker B: And how many of those happened, Afghanistan got crushed with one of those things you call tanks. How many tanks just ran over them?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Crushed every bone. Their bites just instantly crushed their lives. There's no compassion in that part of the world.\n",
            "Speaker A: No.\n",
            "Speaker B: Once the monster is let out, there's no compassion.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right. And war has been going on there for so long now.\n",
            "Speaker B: Since the beginning of time. Yeah, before. Since Moses.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's what's really insane about thinking when you think about a place like Iraq. Like Iraq has a history that goes all the way back to ancient Babylon. Ancient Sumer.\n",
            "Speaker B: They would not let they destroy that stuff over there.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, they did.\n",
            "Speaker B: They're extremists. Anything that. Anything that threatens Allah, they destroy.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's amazing to watch because these are these beautiful ancient statues and they dynamite them and you're like, wow, it threatened.\n",
            "Speaker B: They threatened the humanity to those people.\n",
            "Speaker A: No, but it's like. Did not. To not understand the value of something that's so ancient, so beautiful and was created by people thousands and thousands of years ago. People enslaved the people that made it, you mean.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, listen, now I found out they probably were, but listen, probably not all the Egyptians were. They did it from the. For goddess purpose.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, they think the Egyptians were skilled workers by the food that they ate and where they lived in.\n",
            "Speaker B: I thought it was slavery too. No, it was in the name of God.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, it kind of makes sense that it wasn't slavery because I'm sure there was some slavery. Right. But I mean, but the actual construction of it is so skillful, like it has to be so precise. But you can't be off anywhere in any direction. And the stones are so big.\n",
            "Speaker B: The Egyptians were big liars.\n",
            "Speaker A: They were lying.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, they always did pictures. They're very conscious of the image. They were fat ones. They never showed fatty.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, so the paintings of them.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, they had Egyptians getting high. They don't show that they had the cocaine put in. The cocaine mummy, please.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah. They found cocaine residential. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, no, more than that. Show them the cocaine mummy. They said cocaine in his hair.\n",
            "Speaker A: In his hair.\n",
            "Speaker B: There's no cocaine. Don't grow in that part of the world. So, you know, they did a lot of traveling and trade, right?\n",
            "Speaker A: That's right, that's right.\n",
            "Speaker B: Because Columbia. Columbia has pyramids too.\n",

            "Speaker A: Cocaine metabolites in pre columbian mummy hair. There it is chewing of cocoles because of this pre columbian populations. Eight chilean mummies with dates ranging from 2000 BC to 15 AD. I think there was an egyptian mummy too, though, Jamie. Where they found some cocaine residue. I think we're combining two stories.\n",
            "Speaker B: Cocaine was used as a medicine.\n",
            "Speaker C: Was the best.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good one too, though. That's a good one too. They were definitely doing coke.\n",

A german 1992 german toxicologist say that names vet Lana Balabanova discovered traces of cocaine, hashish and nicotine in Hanoot Tawi's hair. I hope I'm saying that right. As well as on the hair of several. Several other mummies in the museum. Interesting. So they were doing coke and they.\n",
            "Speaker B: Smoked cigarettes as well?\n",
            "Speaker A: I think they. They think there was. There was something else that might have registered positive for cocaine.\n",
            "Speaker B: I think the cocaine was when they did it. Was the stuff painless? When they stopped, they did it for the painkillers, whatever it was.\n",
            "Speaker A: I just don't think. I don't. After these experiments, assuming the cocaine was actually found in the mummies, it's possible that could be contamination which occurred after this discovery of the mummies.\n",

She would kill them and bathing them. But then the thing is, like, if you do know that they were trying to get her land, like, that sounds like something someone would make up.

Matthias, then king of Hungary, to investigate the count Palpatine Palatine determined after taking depositions from the people living in the area surrounding her estate, that Bathory had tortured and killed more than 600 girls with the assistance of her servants. Wow. Okay. That's a lot. If you get maybe.\n",

            "Speaker A: Yeah, so it says. Documents from the 1611 trial supported the accusations made against her. Modern scholarship has questioned the veracity of the allegations because Bathory was a powerful woman and made more so by her control of Nadasdi's holdings after his death. And so there was a lot of money involved. So this Matthias owed money to Bathory, and that money was canceled out for permitting them to manage her.\n",

            "Speaker A: And the opposite. When you put old rat blood on a young rat, they behave slowly and tired. Yeah, there was a thing that was going around that they were saying that billionaires, tech billionaires, were doing that and that they were getting young people were donating blood, and they were getting young blood transfused into their blood.

Because we had heard, like, Peter Thiel or some of the rich billionaire type characters, you know, that was always like, the rumor that they were investing in these companies.\n",

The mind altering agents such as tobacco, cannabis and opium have been widely used since the evolution of the human being. The substances have been widely used for recreational purposes. However, derivatives from reptiles and snakes, reptiles and scorpions can also be used for recreational purposes as a substitute for other substances. The use is rare and related literature is very scanty. In this report, we present a case of snake venom abuse and review the existing literature. Wow, that's crazy. Dudes were doing snake venom.\n",

He wrote a book on psychedelic mushrooms and Jesus. It was called the Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. And he was one of those guys that decoded the Dead Sea Scrolls. So he was a scholar and he was also an ordained minister, but he became agnostic after he started reading all this biblical literature and stuff and realizing that a lot of these stories come from older and older stories. So he reads this thing for 14 years and decodes it, and he comes up with this theory that Christianity was really based around psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults. And this whole story about like, what Jesus is, like the word Jesus in this guy's translation of ancient Sumerian is a mushroom covered in God's semen.\n",
            "Speaker B: But Jesus story goes all the way back to Babylon.\n",

            "Speaker B: But the same story, he thinks the.\n",
            "Speaker A: Origins of that story is all psychedelic mushrooms. That's what he thinks. He thinks people, ancient people, found these psychedelic mushrooms and get connected to God. And through eating them, they developed this moral and ethical framework of how to live. God gave them visions of how to do things the right way. And he thinks it all came from the consumption these psychedelic mushrooms. And this guy was a straight, like, academic. He wasn't a crazy person. He wasn't like some Timothy Leary guy who was like off the deep end. He was a straight laced, sober academic who came up with this theory. It's very interesting stuff.\n",

            "Speaker A: Oh, my God. That was from a motorcycle crash. Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: I was fucked up. I just broke my shoulder, and then I never knew it was broken. The doctor said, how long was your shoulder broken? I said, my shoulder's never been broken, so, yes, it is broken. I never knew my shoulder was broken.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's crazy. You just let it heal.\n",
            "Speaker B: Wow. I didn't even knew if I knew when I went to the doctor, right.\n",
            "Speaker A: That was one of the craziest post fight interviews ever where you were explaining that you broke your back.\n",

            "Speaker A: Backs are a motherfucker. Cause as soon as they start going, you finish.\n",

            "Speaker A: You gotta keep. Stay mobile.\n",
            "Speaker B: Once you keep sitting around a sciatica, fit comes. I don't care how healthy you are, how much in shape it comes in. When you sit too much, you're looking at home watching television.\n",

            "Speaker B: No. I probably need to.\n",
            "Speaker A: I just thought of it right now when you said that. I was like, goddamn, Mike would be great at yoga. Cause you would get obsessed with it. It's hard to do. Yeah, it's fucking hard.\n",
            "Speaker B: My family don't like my obsession habit.\n",

            "Speaker B: Hey, sometimes you forget to eat the whole day. It's just. I can't even explain it. It's euphoric, but you can't even explain. You totally forget to eat at nighttime. You just forget to eat. It's just intense, the really calm intensity.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's got to be good to give your digestive system a break every now and then. I mean, it only makes sense. That's a good idea.\n",
            "Speaker B: People eat too much as it is, for sure. We as a race. Yeah, we as a race. Human beings as a race, we eat too much as it is. Not only do we eat too much, we eat what kills us quicker.\n",
            "Speaker A: I know, and it's everywhere. That's the other thing. What kills us quicker is all over the place.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. And in certain countries, only you don't sell all that fat, all that product, like in sweeteners stuff with all this magical motions and food products in there.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. All the shit that preserves things, all the weird stuff that gives people inflammation we got a lot of that in our diets.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes. Some of these countries ain't gonna feed you all this fat and sugar stuff. They're gonna do it. They get. Think about in the eighties, right? Everybody in Russia was in shape. They must have put a natch in national shape there. Everybody was in shape in the eighties, in Russia. All those countries, those communist countries, they were all in shape. They all won gold medals at the olympics all the time. They were always in shape, always in better condition than Americans. You saw when they did the statistics on how many overweight Americans they are.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: And the guys don't even look overweight or overweight.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right. People, because they don't have any muscle. They're just all fat. Even if they're not that big, you're still obese. Yeah. It's very common because it's the diet. It's so easy to eat cheeseburgers. It's so easy to pull into a drive through. It's nothing wrong with doing it every now and then.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, but we do it constantly.\n",
            "Speaker A: Constantly.\n",
            "Speaker B: When I was a little kid, we didn't have enough money to buy stuff. We had to get free food, free lunches, like, you know, we just didn't have any money. You know, we just, um. It's just. You wouldn't believe America would do that to people. You have to leave people with no money.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: It's. No matter what. You're puerto rican, black from poor white. There's no option to live or anything. It's. You're on your own. If you make it, you make it. If you don't, you don't. This is the only country that's like that. I believe it's.\n",
            "Speaker A: What do you think that is? Do you think it's people? Nothing. Understanding what it's like to be that poor?\n",
            "Speaker B: No. It's about survival of the fittest. I know it sounds bad. Doesn't sound good. In this country, that's what it's all about. A perfect world. Without struggle, there's no progress. They did this. Hey, they did this study with rats. Where utopia. Rat reto rat. Utopia looked at where they gave the rats all the food and all the space they want and all the women and sex they want, and they wind up all killing each other.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. And dying out because they broke up once. They had everything they want, they break up in sets and groups and they start raping and fighting and killing each other. And then they stop breeding and they just all die out. So without struggle, there's no progress. In a perfect world, we're all fucking dead.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow, that's heavy. Cause it makes sense. It makes sense that the rats would need some sort of conflict.\n",
            "Speaker B: There'd be the rats that are the aggressive ones here. The non aggressive. And then there's a group of rats. They're aggressive, but they only consider. They only think about being clean. They stay clean. And they have aggressive ones, too. But cleanliness is what you notice about them. Then you have the victim mouths over there. Then you have the aggressive, aggressive. The aggressive, violent ones over here.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow. We've done a lot of fucked up studies on rats.\n",
            "Speaker B: Think about it. Because we're the rats. We're the big rats. The bigger brain, supposedly.\n",
            "Speaker A: We definitely don't look at all animals the same way. Right. With rats, we feel like we're allowed to do experiments on them. Like we're doing experiments on puppies. People get real mad.\n",
            "Speaker B: Monkeys, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, monkeys too. They feel like monkeys are almost like. Almost like you have to do it.\n",
            "Speaker B: But they look at rats as. Ugh, they're disgusting. They don't look at them like nice, pretty little white rats. They look at those rats, the gutter. Because those are the rats they use. The nice little white rats.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Doing experiments on monkeys is hardcore.\n",
            "Speaker B: The reason they do rats, because rats. Rats and roaches, they have the highest survival rate.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's why we do tests. We do tests because they're robust.\n",
            "Speaker A: They're robust mammals.\n",
            "Speaker B: They're hard to kill. Real hard to kill. Like, I'm talking about from a survival basis. I'm talking about cats and stuff, hunting them, not human beings. Even us involved, they're very difficult to kill.\n",

            "Speaker B: That's how intelligent they were. Huh?\n",
            "Speaker A: They're so intelligent, they'll send a young rat to check out something to see if it's poison. They're like, why don't you go check? And that guy goes over there and eats it. And they watch him, and if he dies, they go, mm mm.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen. Listeners do that, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do they really?\n",
            "Speaker B: If they see. If they see a rooster they don't. Like, they rush him, pluck him. When he starts bleeding. Once you start bleeding, all the other chickens start pecking you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: And if he's one fighting over women here, he'll push you outside if you see the shadow of a hawk or something. Push you outside for the hawk. These guys are extremely smart. Rooster. Rooster.\n",

            "Speaker B: They get jealous.\n",
            "Speaker A: Makes sense, man. Birds are clever. They're a lot more clever than we ever thought they were. Like when they started doing those intelligence tests on crows and ravens, they're like, holy shit, listen.\n",
            "Speaker B: A pigeon. How do you get a pigeon to fly from a thousand miles from here to there, right? And every time you take him, he goes back and you hold him there for five years and let him go and he goes back.\n",
            "Speaker A: How the fuck is that happening?\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't know. I fly birds. I don't know.\n",
            "Speaker A: When you were flying those birds, did you ever wonder, like, how were they communicating? How are they figuring it out? What are they using?\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, this is scientific. I guess. When birds fly just like us, it's electric, right? Some kind of electric. What is electric?\n",
            "Speaker A: Electromagnetic.\n",
            "Speaker B: Some kind of vibe that leads them. That's how it helps the birds to migrate, right? It's some kind of electricity that happens. I can't really. I don't even know how to.\n",
            "Speaker A: I know. I know what you're saying. I don't know how to explain it either, but I know what you're saying. I did read about all.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, static. We're electric, all of us. We have that electric stuff. That's the one. We touch each other. We almost electrocute each other. Every now and then you touch static.\n",

            "Speaker B: Magnetic. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think it's all guesswork, though. They just. They're trying to figure out how they do it. But the way they do it, if.\n",
            "Speaker B: You figure, how do you. How do you know to be responsible to take a whole platoon of birds that never been south and you taking them south? They never been south before, but we're going south. How do they know to go south.\n",
            "Speaker A: And they all stay in line.\n",
            "Speaker B: If they all been in this one place breathing right now, we gotta go south or else. One place hanging out, now we gotta go south and breed.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's a whole different kind of animal. Something that flies. How wild that must be to just all that bullshit going on the ground. You don't have to fuck with that. You just get up in the sky.\n",
            "Speaker B: But listen, listen, you still gotta come down and eat like everybody else. Yes, you still gotta come off the throne and eat.\n",
            "Speaker A: You definitely do. But what a wild way to live, you know, swooping down on shit.\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, you gotta worry about shit swooping down on you, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: True. Researchers have discovered a small spot on the beak of pigeons and some of the birds that contains magnetite. Magnetite is a magnetized rock, which may act as a tiny gps unit for the homing pigeon by giving it information about its position relative to Earth's poles. Holy fuck. Researchers have also found some specialized cells in birds eyes that may help them see magnetic fields. Wow. It is thought that birds can use both the beak magnetite and the eye sensors to travel long distances over areas that do not have many landmarks, such as the ocean. That's incredible. In humans, deposits of magnetite have been found in bones, in our noses. Do you think we use the earth's magnetic field to know which way we are headed? Wow. A wonderful, even human. Maybe that's something like the appendix that we grew out of, you know?\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, some people just walk as kids. Some people just walk. They walk for miles for somebody to walk.\n",

            "Speaker B: They can smell a period for so many. Oh, I can only imagine another bear.\n",
            "Speaker A: Polar bear can smell seals and other animals up to 9 away. They can even smell the breathing holes seals create in the ice from almost 1 km. So although polar bear hunting ranges can span several hundred miles, their sharp olfactory scents help keep them fed. So they smell for miles and miles and they know which way to go. So if a polar bear has a period or if any animal's wounded or bleeding. 20 miles.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know that was something like that. It was even more than that.\n",
            "Speaker A: They could smell a seal on ice 20 miles away. That is fucking crazy. Hold on, put that up again. That is so crazy. Sniff out a seal's den that has been covered in snow and even find a seal's air hole in ice up to 1 mile away. Wow. Well, they have to have that. You imagine what that. Imagine that thing smell a tiger fart.\n",
            "Speaker B: It could smell from miles away.\n",
            "Speaker A: Miles away. Someone explained to me the way a dog smells by, they were talking about skunk. Like, you know, a skunk can only, it only takes like a few parts per million and you could smell skunk like there's a weird smell. Like when the skunk gets killed by a car in your neighborhood. Like everybody smells it for like a mile away. That's the only smell that we know. That's like that. That's like an organic smell. And he was saying, now imagine that plus times ten for everything. Like everything he said a dog, like a bloodhound, can smell not just your cheeseburger. They could smell the ketchup.\n",
            "Speaker B: Ketchup, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: They could smell the pickles. They could smell the cheese. They smell the bun. Yeah.\n",

            "Speaker B: It looked like a dog.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's a giant bear that lived again during the ice age. And they think it might have even prevented people from crossing over that land bridge between Asia and North America. They think it might have been habitat. Look at the size of that. Look at the size of that fucking thing. That's a short faced bear. They think it might have inhabited that. That area in between the two continents. And they were so predatory that it would have prevented travel. Like, look how big that is.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. Well, you could tell he couldn't live long because he had to run it down because everything else would be too small for him. He had to be able to run the prey down.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, he's. Look at the way he's built. I mean, that's not built like a bear. Like we think of that short faced bear. The way the length of the limbs. It looks like something that could run fast. That's what's terrifying.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's not gonna. He's gonna do good in the prairie, but he's not gonna do good coming down the hills and going up mountains.\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't know what he's gonna do good at, but he's gonna do good at eating people. I'll tell you.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's why he didn't survive. That's why he didn't survive. He was too big, probably. You can see him.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, probably. They probably hunted him to extinction. I mean, if you found out that something like that was out there killing everybody.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, you find that you can stay warm from his coat by eating meat.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's true, too.\n",

            "Speaker A: Well, definitely not today. Today we're running the food chain. There's no question. And that's one of the weird things about, like, human conflict. Right? You're talking about we always have to have some kind of conflict. Like, we were talking about the rat study that exists with us, too.\n",
            "Speaker B: Right? You have to have conflict. Conflict. There's no doubt about it. If you can't, if you don't have nobody to fight, you find somebody to fight, you make somebody to fight.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right. You got to either make your own conflict, or you, like, choose conflict or cause conflict.\n",

            "Speaker A: You see, they get. Whether it's, like, a woman's right to choose, abortion rights. They're real aggressive. Like, nice people could say real mean, horrible things. If it's about that.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. If you talk about, you know, I don't even say, my daughter's a part of the unit, the young ladies that want to become Mendez. I'm a big supporter, you know, I have a daughter that's in that. I don't know, what do you call it? Community group. It's a community. And I love her. I respect her, so I respect the community, you know, that's pretty much. I know she's a part of the community, and she's very aggressive, like you were saying. I had a young man named Little Bootsie, young rapper. You have to know he has cursed a lot in his music and stuff, and he said something negative about Dwyane Wade's son. I believe he has a gay son or something, and he says something disrespectful about him. And my daughter came to my. She lives in New York. She came from New York to Los Angeles because she knew I was interviewing this guy, came in the room and sat down and said, what do you think? Who do you think you ought to talk about people like that that don't even talk about you. Jn said nothing about you. Why did you have to talk about? And I'm like, whoa. I said, where did this come from? I didn't know she was coming here. I said, what is she doing here? What is she. You know, why is she disrespecting my space? She comes in my, like, come in here right now. Your sister, your daughter, come in here right now and looks at this guy and says, hey, who you think you are talking to Dwayne Wade, son. And I'm like, hey, how did this, how do I handle this? This guy's gonna say something stupid and then I'm gonna lose my job. I have to defend my daughter, even if she's wrong. I have to defend if this guy's disrespectful. And I'm glad this guy was respectful enough and he was a dignified guy and had more respect than people thought he did. And he listened out and he. It was just, it was just interesting to see somebody that I brought in this world handle an issue. You understand that somebody that I love is willing to die for some issue. I don't. I don't really, I have no, you know, I don't know. I'm not against them, but now I'm. Now I'm with these people without even wanting to be involved with this in a way.

            "Speaker A: Rose is no joke, man.\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, no, not at all.\n",
            "Speaker A: She's so serious. And when she was before that fight, this was. I talked to her about it in the post fight interview. She was standing there while they're, like, introducing the fighters, and she's sitting there going, I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. She just kept saying that.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what I say.\n",
            "Speaker A: She just kept saying it.\n",

            "Speaker A: Right, but you were right at the time. You were right when she saying it. She was right, too. She was right. She channeled it like she made. Look at her right here.\n",
            "Speaker B: She's ready.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, she's just going, I'm the best. I'm the best. And then when I interviewed her afterwards, she goes, yeah, I am the best. And we were laughing. It was really funny. Like, I asked her about it. Buffer was saying your name.\n",
            "Speaker B: You were saying to yourself, I'm the best. I'm the best. I am the best.\n",
            "Speaker A: I mean, come on, how do you not love her? There's no doubt about that now.\n",

            "Speaker A: There's a lot to that when you're expressing yourself in a fight, when you watch, like, a perfect performance, I mean, the excited energy that spreads from people watching that all over the world. Like, if somebody watched one of your great knockouts, if you were watching it live, all these people watching together, this excited burst of energy goes through the whole world.\n",
            "Speaker B: I always wish I could be in the stands watching me fight.\n",

            "Speaker A: What amongst most people don't even know the Duran pre welterweight? They think of Duran as being welterweight.\n",
            "Speaker B: He was seven years undefeated champion.\n",
            "Speaker A: He was a vicious mother the fucker at lightweight. My God, he was good. That was probably his best division, right? Yeah, he was just an intelligent savage.\n",
            "Speaker B: Exactly. When he went up in weight, he was outboxing these monsters like Hagler. And these guys just boxing. They thought Hagler was gonna kill him.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, and Hagler was haggar back then.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, he was the whole twelve or 15 rounds, whatever.\n",
            "Speaker A: It was crazy close decision, too. It was a close fight. Well, even when he fought Davey Moore, people thought he was.\n",
            "Speaker B: I was at that fight. Were you really? I was, I was 18. I was at that fight. Was I 18? I was 18 or 17? I was at that fight.\n",
            "Speaker A: I'll never forget, I didn't watch that fight live. Cause I was sad. Cause it was like post no mas. Duran went through a period of darkness, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: But I saw like David Moore at the time had like nine fights, ten fights. Duran had what, 80 fights? Duran had a lot of fights. 100 fights in his career.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, he had a lot of fights. And when he dropped Davey Moore, oh.\n",
            "Speaker B: I was right that the crowd went quick. Listen, it was nothing but 20, 19,850 Latinos, okay? Whole 20,000, man, only 500 people, probably 200 people weren't Latino. Okay? 19,000 people, 800. That was all Latino.\n",
            "Speaker A: Did you see, is it called the four kings? What is that documentary?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, Hagler Leonardo. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Hagler Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Duran. And they followed their career. They follow their ascension.\n",
            "Speaker B: They weren't afraid to fight each other.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, man, they fought each other in wars, man.\n",
            "Speaker B: Crazy. They would never do that now.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, I mean, maybe if you stirred the right amount of money around.\n",
            "Speaker B: But listen, Duran and her, they made more money than the welterweights do now, probably, right? No, they did. They had 7000, 20 million. I mean, 7 million, $20 million fights. These welterweights, nobody in this welterweight gets $20 million fights. Probably Pacquiao. But nobody in here gets that kind of money that Glendon and Duran got.\n",
            "Speaker A: They kind of have to fight it out, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, the best fought the best. That's why they got the most money.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you think that's possible today? Like, if that would be the possible you'd have if you had a tournament that would get together like Terrence Crawford, Earl Spence, all these guys. I mean, Pacquiao's kind of, I think he's retired.\n",
            "Speaker B: I think he can still fight and still beat some of these guys.\n",
            "Speaker A: He still can. Yes.\n",
            "Speaker B: He just beat Thurman. Thurman's no bum. At no measure at all.\n",
            "Speaker A: No, not at all. And dropped him, right hand.\n",
            "Speaker B: The guy that he fought, the cuban, that guy was just awkward. Long arms and stuff. He should have fought somebody else.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, it was a big change in opponent, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Who's he supposed to fight?\n",
            "Speaker B: He's supposed to fight a big name guy, right? The guy put. But this guy, just one of those cuban fighters, he's awkward. It's hard to fight, and it's gonna be tough. I mean, Spence, too. This guy Spence, some problems, too. I think I might be wrong. Spence might hit him on the chin. He's knocking cold.\n",
            "Speaker A: Spence has serious power. He's good.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's good to be more active.\n",

            "Speaker A: He should be dead. Yeah, he should be dead. I mean, he's so fortunate.\n",
            "Speaker B: I mean, he should be one of these insane to him. Somebody's brain should be rattled flat. The car.\n",

            "Speaker B: That's just like.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think all he did was chip a tooth.\n",

            "Speaker A: Fly out of the fucking car.\n",
            "Speaker B: I've been dead. I didn't. What happened to me? Broke his pinky or something.\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't think it was that bad. Whatever it was was not that bad. I mean, I was watching him hit meds.\n",
            "Speaker B: Was he drunk and stuff when that happened?\n",
            "Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know. I just know he lost control. It was a Ferrari. You know, a car like that is so fucking fast. The average person who doesn't know how to drive that good can get themselves in trouble real quick with one of those.\n",
            "Speaker B: I've got. I've had gotten so many speed and tickets in my life. Yeah, it's racing. Other people.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: I see them with their porsche and muffler. Let's go.\n",

            "Speaker A: Give yourself a treat.\n",
            "Speaker B: So I buy it one of these super after Martin cars that they don't have to specs for the United States. So I get this dealer plate so I could drive this car. That's illegal in the states, but if I put dealer plates on it, I can drive it. Isn't that incredible?\n",
            "Speaker A: That is incredible.\n",
            "Speaker B: If I got dealer plates, I could take this car that has no specs and drive it in this country, that that's illegal. Guess because I have the plates.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know what's another crazy thing you can do?\n",
            "Speaker B: I can't own the car to drive it in the country.\n",

            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: So you could be from another country and have other countries plates and drive around cars in America. So, like, guys come from Saudi Arabia, they're ballers. They got all this crazy money. They buy lamborghinis, and they have these diplomat plates on. They ride around Beverly Hills.\n",

            "Speaker B: Jeez, I had one of those. Yeah, I saw him. I was in Saudi Arabia, and they saw the race, but I got involved with the race, and so I said, when I come home, I'm gonna buy one of these.\n",
            "Speaker A: That was before people were buying suv's. There wasn't a lot of people buying Suzuki.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, but that was a monster. That car was a monster. You couldn't afford the monster. I had the white one and I had the black one.\n",

            "Speaker A: It's wild looking. It's got like the innards. I think some of it is from jeep. And then they redid the whole thing and they sell them, they're bulletproof. Sometimes they sell them, they do all kinds of wacky shit, like they spray smoke out of the back of them.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, listen, listen. I was the first guy that had, they had a car. Boom. I pressed a button, got tax come out, big tax. Give you a flats and shit. I pressed the button, I got smoke come out. You had that? Yeah, I had that before anybody. I had the iron tacks come out to get the cops. Flat tires and everything. That's hilarious. Their big nails.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow. That's crazy. They were doing that back then.\n",
            "Speaker B: And then I could know what else. I could put oil on the floor to make the car slip.\n",
            "Speaker A: Look at this shit. Electromagnetic pulse protection.\n",
            "Speaker B: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker A: Radiated from a nuclear explosion and rendered electronic devices inoperable. Oh, Jesus Christ. They're talking about surviving nuclear explosion in your jeep.\n",

            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: They're the only one that can see that the bear is not white. You see his white coat? It's not, it's effervescent. I forgot what the word evervestin. And the deer can see it. That's why when they cover the nose, he covers his nose only for the seals and stuff, but the deer can see his fur. It's not white. It's ever vessel.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's the way what it is. It's. I think it's transparent.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, that's what it is. Something. It's like a clear and. Yeah, it just looks. See it? And that's how these spots. And you can see it because the polar bear is really black, you know? Right.\n",
            "Speaker A: The body is. Yeah, it's covered by the skin.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, the skin is black and the fur is effervescent.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, whatever it is.\n",
            "Speaker B: But how does that work? He's black, but how does that.\n",
            "Speaker A: There's so much.\n",
            "Speaker B: But it's not white because it's white.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's clear. It's clear. And there's so much of it that's stacked on top, it looks white. And then it covers all of the body because it's amazing insulation. Apparently the hairs on a polar bear are very different. They're like a tube.\n",
            "Speaker B: And then they float.\n",
            "Speaker A: Really?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, they. He floats. He can't think. He's afloat. He sits out there.\n",
            "Speaker A: That makes sense. That makes sense. They're like little tubes. You can also swim. Like, they dive underwater and get seals and shit and come out with.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, but they can't think. Mmm. I forgot what they call it, but they. Buoyancy. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: So what's a scary ass animal? Because polar bears. Nothing animal. Where they see you, they're coming to kill you. Nothing's they don't like. They're not.\n",
            "Speaker B: Bears are two grizzly bears. As soon as they see, they attack you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Some grizzly bears will.\n",
            "Speaker B: But sometimes they see you, they attack you.\n",
            "Speaker A: But grizzly bears eat grass and they eat berries and they eat fruit and animals and then they eat animals that they catch. But polar bears only eat meat.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's the difference. They don't eat any berries up there.\n",
            "Speaker B: The reason why is because of the cold.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: There's no berries growing. The cold.\n",
            "Speaker A: No berries grow in the cold. This friend of mine is very smart and he, you know, he talks about every. He goes, everybody's worried about global warming. And he goes, it's definitely something you should be concerned about. He goes, but you know what you should really be concerned about? Global cooling. He goes, if the world gets too warm, he goes, we can survive. If the world gets too cold, we're fucked. We can't grow any food.\n",
            "Speaker B: But eventually it will.\n",
            "Speaker A: Maybe it has.\n",

            "Speaker A: Oh, like, like an old city that they discovered.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure. I think anytime you got like a community that lives by the ocean, that ocean moves, man. I mean, especially over history and thousands of years of people being alive. That fucking thing.\n",
            "Speaker B: France, like we were saying before, like 40,000 years, it was attached to Africa.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: I didn't know that 40,000 years ago was attached. Something must have happened. The ocean must have flooded something. But it used to be connected.\n",

            "Speaker B: And sometimes you see them. The ancestors of it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Giant sloths and stuff like that. Or would they go way back and they find actual dinosaurs? You find things that are 100 and 5250 million years old. Like what? This is a 250 million year old skeleton. What the fuck?\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, listen. How do we tell time? How do we tell it it's 250 years old? Forget the bones.\n",
            "Speaker A: Good question.\n",

            "Speaker A: No, they do. They. I think they take a piece of it and then they measure the amount.\n",
            "Speaker B: They don't know. They do that because they don't know. And they tell you. This is how we tell they.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think they can only tell within a large. It's not like they can tell the weak that it. They. You know, this thing was put in the ground. They can tell you, like, within x amount of years. And they just guess based on how much carbon is still in the. The object. They're like, things have a base level of carbon, apparently.

            "Speaker A: What I'm willing to listen to is the process in which they figured out how to measure how much carbon is in a thing. And then, like, how they figured out that if you applied that the things that you knew were a certain amount of age old, you could get like sort of a formula to calculate how.\n",

            "Speaker B: Oh, that's recently. A couple of hundred years, I don't think. A couple hundred thousand of years. When I'm talking about when it was on the book. We were human. When did that happen?\n",
            "Speaker A: I think homo sapiens. I think you're looking at like a half a million years.\n",
            "Speaker B: Is that right?\n",
            "Speaker A: I think that's supposedly what we are. We're a half a million years old.\n",
            "Speaker B: But then we had to go through the Mongolia times. Mongoloids.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Well, there's also. That's coexisting with neanderthals. Coexisting with those. Those Hobbit people on the island of Flores. You see, you've seen that. That's wild, man.\n",
            "Speaker B: Do you ever see the island outside of India?\n",
            "Speaker A: North Sentinel island? Yes, yes. Yeah. That's where the missionary went to deliver the Bible.\n",
            "Speaker B: Jesus loves you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow. Build them up, man, hard. I do a bit of that. Unfortunately.\n",
            "Speaker B: They did a. They put a rope around his neck and drug him into the. They killed him and fucked and did all kinds of shit. Listen, did you see what's up? What's my man, name of jackass? Come on. My man.\n",
            "Speaker A: Knoxville.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, no, Steve O. Steve. Oh, you ever see Steve O? Steve O's with some indigenous people and they're trying to eat them. Put that with some indigenous nigga eating on a hump to that. Oh, you gotta see this stuff, man.\n",
            "Speaker A: Steve.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, and indigenous people.\n",
            "Speaker A: Steve. Oh, so crazy. But, yeah, that north Sentinel Islandhouse, that. That's a crazy story.\n",
            "Speaker B: I wonder what's in that. You know, in the core that. What they have there, who they're eating, what they're doing, how they function.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's. They not enough of them.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know, but they know to fucking shoot you with a bow and arrow.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, they know to shoot you with a bow and arrow, but I think they're worried about. I think they've been fucked with. No story.\n",
            "Speaker B: We go there, we get them sick. Yeah, exactly. Inoculate. As soon as we go there. Look at them. We get too close they get sick and die.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's why they kill us, because they say all of a sudden we get next to these guys, we die.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, they probably have stories about people who visited and got people sick.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Listen, they went there one time and they took a couple of them, kidnapped, and they started dying. And so they sent them back. But, yeah, we killed them. We're disgusting. We have diseases and stuff.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: We get inoculated, we can still kill these guys.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, we were just talking about this, that 90% of the people in North America were dead because of viruses. 90% of them. When the Europeans showed up, it killed everybody.\n",
            "Speaker B: Syphilis wiped them out.\n",
            "Speaker A: Everybody.\n",
            "Speaker B: And syphilis comes from skin disease, from not being.\n",
            "Speaker A: Hygiene.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hygiene, really? And then we started becoming more hygienic and started getting clean and it started dying. And so it went inside of us. It went into our vaginal system to survive. And that's how we got to syphilis. Only a skin disease started. Disease. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Holy shit.\n",
            "Speaker B: And then they wanted to survive because people started living cleanly and they wanted to survive. So it went into a vaginal.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow. Whoa.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes. You should look at the history of venereal diseases. Always look at the history of stuff, and it blows my mind.\n",
            "Speaker A: I've always wondered. Cause it's a crazy thing to have diseases that specifically come through sex. It's kind of crazy. And how many of them killed people.\n",
            "Speaker B: Is a way, by checking our animalistic.\n",
            "Speaker A: Tendency, checking our drive. Yeah. Give us a disease that makes us fucking dangerous.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's on you now. It's on you. But we're conscious of it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Do you know about the whole powdered wig thing?\n",
            "Speaker B: Tell me about the powdered wig.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know those old dudes in, like, ancient times, they wore that because of syphilis.\n",
            "Speaker B: Really?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yes. This guy was a French.\n",
            "Speaker B: Rats and stuff got in those guys.\n",
            "Speaker A: I'm sure they probably did. But the guy who started it off, it's attributed to these two French. They were cousins, right? Weren't they cousins? I think they were cousins, but they were, you know, royalty big time. You know, big people. And when they started getting syphilis, their hair was falling out, so they got wigs. And so this is what would happen to these people's heads.\n",
            "Speaker B: It impacts the brain. Impacts your brain.\n",
            "Speaker A: It impacts everything I've seen.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, man. I don't even like seeing.\n",
            "Speaker A: They get holes in their faces. So the more money you have, the bigger the wig was. So that's why the term big wig, that's where it came from. The term big wig. Goes back to when these european men were all getting syphilis. What about, um, their fucking hair was falling out. It's wild.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, syphilis is nothing there. But before, it was a dead man's disease. Once you got that, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: I mean, it dragged holes through people. Isn't that what killed Al Pacino or Al Capone, rather, alone. Al Capone? Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Bo brimmel.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, it makes your fucking face rot off, too.\n",
            "Speaker B: Attacks your brain.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, what a terrible way to go. But it's just crazy that there's so many diseases like that just come from fucking. It's wild.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's just. I don't know, I think it's just a natural.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Form of trying to check us is humanity checking us.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think you're dead right. I think that's exactly what it is. It just may make sense that something like that would. Otherwise we would just fuck up a storm. As much food as we eat.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, listen. Have you ever listened to how life was and sex was at roman time? It's right in the streets.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yep.\n",
            "Speaker B: Slaves are getting pumped in the streets. You're fighting the streets. You're taking dumps in the street.\n",
            "Speaker A: Crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's nothing. It's just, okay, you're slaves. You do whatever right in the middle of the streets. It's everything. And then I. And then I guess they start this. Who are there? Which one was it? The roman emperor Augustus. I think he started making, he was having a moral check on people, started giving people more. He was a philosopher warrior. After he won all the wars and killed everybody, he became a peaceful philosopher.\n",
            "Speaker A: Marcus Aurelius.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes. That's who it is. Marcus.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Marcus Aurelius. Yeah. Marcus Aurelius is meditations. I'm in the middle of that right now.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Listen, this is beautiful. It's amazing. But this is a bloodthirsty monarch that's telling us this.\n",
            "Speaker A: True.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's seen the light, but this guy didn't. Oh, he wrecked some. Ooh. He did so. He dominated countries.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Decimated them.\n",
            "Speaker A: They all did. You know, the wild thing about Rome, particularly, like, the roman emperors and the Roman Coliseum, is you could still go there today and stand on the very ground where the coliseum was. Like, I went for a tour in the coliseum.\n",
            "Speaker B: Did you go in the ground with animals and the warriors?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Where they used to have animals would come up on, like, elevators would rise up, they'd pull them on pulleys, they'd pull up to the top and there would be a warrior waiting with, like, a shield and a sword to fight off a tiger.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, the gladiators back there was the equivalent of mma. Fighters and fighters now, yeah, they were superstars. They weren't enslaved, right? They wouldn't. When they wouldn't, they wouldn't have freedom three or four times. They wouldn't give up. They still. They wanted to fight till they die, you know? Cause they love the attention.\n",
            "Speaker A: Totally makes sense.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, they showed ancient times in Rome. I don't know if they showed the ancient time how people lived. They had a couch, had a little table, and they had a picture of a warrior up there. It's like we might have a fighter or something. They had a warrior take chiseled in the wall.\n",
            "Speaker A: Makes sense.\n",
            "Speaker B: It was just like modern time. They had the hash, too. They had the hash to get high on the table stuff.\n",
            "Speaker A: It was just more ruthless than today because life was more lifeless.\n",
            "Speaker B: Life was nothing back then. Life was slaves and stuff. Everybody owned everybody.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know what someone said to me, too, about the Spartans? He was saying, if you were a spartan and you were a 30 year old man, people were suspicious of you. Like, how did you make it this far? Like, are you a coward? Did you turn on people? Like, how did you survive to be 30? I just be nervous of you.\n",
            "Speaker B: The best ones, the ones that won their freedoms, and you just kept fighting. They were all vegans and vegetarians. They checked the marrow of their bone. Very. The amount of meat they had was almost doesn't exist.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, that's because they were feeding all the gladiators. They were feeding like a gruel. It was like they ate very small meat.\n",
            "Speaker B: Didn't even matter.\n",
            "Speaker A: But that wasn't for performance.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't know, but those were the best. Not all of them won their freedom, but the best ones had no meat.\n",
            "Speaker A: Interesting. I wonder what a normal person ate back then. Like, I wonder how much of, how much they got of meat, how much they, if they fell their bellies.\n",
            "Speaker B: Only the rich ate with meat and stuff, really? Very rarely the slaves eat with me. Unless your master love juice treated you special. You were the sellout or something, you know?\n",
            "Speaker A: Right, right. Yeah. I would imagine that's why people were so small back then, too, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. But they were a lot of disease infested back. They were very sick back then.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, there was no medicine, so you must. Diseases must just ran rampant through people. You know, I talked to this guy, doctor Peter Hotez. He's an infectious disease expert, and he told me that in jungle climates like in the Amazon and places like, anywhere you got a jungle climate. He goes, almost everybody has parasites. Almost everybody.\n",
            "Speaker B: Almost anything could kill you there. It's also anything could kill you. A little bug like this can kill you in Amazon.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, but he was basically saying that it's almost unavoidable to get parasitic infections when you're in these tropical climates. It's just. It's a normal thing.\n",
            "Speaker B: And you're dealing with a situation like we talk about the cynical people.\n",
            "Speaker A: Mm hmm.\n",
            "Speaker B: And what, 40,000 years, something like that. No one never had a pap smear.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: You think, but they've been there for 40,000 years and no one got a pap smear. And 40,000 years, also just a specimen of your urine or something. Never been there, like, 40 years. 40,000 years, just living 40,000 years. Never had a pap smear. Cause that's how long they've been there. They said 40,000 years. How long have the Senegals been there?\n",
            "Speaker A: Having a Jamie around.\n",
            "Speaker B: Jamie is off the hook.\n",
            "Speaker A: He's fast.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, this is what it is. It's a form of slavery. This stuff right here. Hey, Jamie, go do that. It's like, yeah, it's a form of not being in control. You don't have to think, well, he.\n",
            "Speaker A: Plays a very valid role. It's important. I can't be thinking, absolutely. And he can do it with one hand. That's the crazy thing about Jamie. You don't realize he's googling this shit with one hand.\n",
            "Speaker B: But, you know, in slavery times, people have slaves to think for them. People have slaves. Some emperors, they have slaves to remind them that they're human. Remind me that I'm human. Okay.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, because sometimes people tell them they're gods and they're starting to believe, and their slave job is to remind them that they're human.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Could you imagine being a king back then where you could just get people.\n",
            "Speaker B: Being Alexander the Great? Imagine being that Osiris the great. One of those guys. Hannibal, Miss Kong, chilling on. Those guys will die for you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Henry VIII killing your ex wives. Just chop that bitches head off.\n",
            "Speaker B: See, diseases got him, too. That's why he got messed up.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, he was a fucking barbarian. What a horrible person. I mean, you imagine you get divorced with a lady, just cut her head off.\n",
            "Speaker B: Hey, but listen, imagine what he seen in his family before he was king.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: Imagine how many people in his family died before he could become king.\n",
            "Speaker A: But what's crazy is that's, like, normal king behavior. Like when you talk about someone like Henry VIII or any. Any ancient dictator that did horrible things to people, it's normal. It's normal that these kings treated their people in terrible ways. There was more common than for them to be good.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know what a king is? Napoleon said this to his mother because his mother was mad because he don't suck up enough. He don't know how to suck up the kings royal people and stuff. And he said, mom, there will always be kings, even if they go by different names. And so a king could be. A king could be Drake.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, I mean, he just go, he is the rapper. That's the name. Rapper. That's just another name for kids. A successful rapper. That's another name for king, right. You know, a successful guy might. Mike Tyson Fury, those kind of. That's another name for king, right? You know?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, it is kind of. He's like the king of. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's Elon Musk, you know?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: He's another word for king.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right? It's the same mindset of the same, like, position of power.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes.\n",
            "Speaker A: But just not the same abuse.\n",
            "Speaker B: This is what I found out. You know, when you look at Henry the 8th and stuff, that's life. That's. Listen, you. You Joe Rogan, this is your. This is your crew. You're around you most of the time, you know, most of their business, too. Things go on. So you have to find everything you say. You go to him. Jamie, what's going on today? Well, he'll say, well, John came in late today. Bill came over here. We had a great time last night, but, um, he left early today. And that's just what you want to know. Everybody, what they're doing. You want to know everybody's around you. They're taking care of your life. So you want to know how their life is. Their life is.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's true. But over here, fortunately, everything runs so smooth. I don't have to have any of the conversations.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know, but you're a king, and you're responsible for that. You don't have to have the conversation, but that's. That's on you.\n",
            "Speaker A: I know what you're saying.\n",
            "Speaker B: You choose not.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, I choose to trust people some kings don't have. Yeah, well, I've been a peasant for many years. I understand, you know, what it's like to be real broke and poor. I was thinking about that today while I was washing my car today. I was thinking, man, I remember when I worked for a fucking car wash.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, but you never been. You never been poor. Poor's a frame of mind. If you were poor, you'd never be where you are now.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right? I just didn't have any money and I was just young. But that never escapes you, you know? Like, you always, always feel weird about people being. Working for you.\n",
            "Speaker B: And it seems strange because you dealt with poverty before.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't care how much money you have, you can't escape poverty.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think it was a gift. I mean, it was horrible at the time, but being a child and being on welfare. Right. Only good.\n",
            "Speaker B: If you survive, it's good.\n",
            "Speaker A: But that's why when those kind of subjects come up, I'm so adamant that we need some sort of a social net for people to help people if they're broken. Cause if it's not a baby's fault that his mother doesn't have any money, it's not the child's fault that he was born in.\n",
            "Speaker B: Brother. Brother. You can't do that. I think that, too. They have to deal with adversity. We have to find out who they are. They have to find out who they are.\n",
            "Speaker A: But shouldn't there be at least a method for them to eat?\n",
            "Speaker B: I had to find out who I. No, I had to. I had to find out how to eat myself.\n",
            "Speaker A: Phew.\n",
            "Speaker B: I had to find out. I had to go to free lunches. If I see some free lunches and it's too close, I take their free lunch. That's just what it is. It's about the Bible or the fittest.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's interesting because you're one of the few people that could get away with saying that.\n",
            "Speaker B: Really?\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Because you were the fittest.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, I'm saying, know how guy like me survived? I don't survive by somebody giving me a job. You take me.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right.\n",
            "Speaker B: Most competitive system, you take me with it, and it's dropped me there.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: It's dropped me in there with this.\n",
            "Speaker A: Competition like a Bruce Lee movie.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's how I flourish. I don't flourish by anybody giving me chance. Hey, you're my fan. No. Boom, put me in there. Let me show you what I could do. Boom, let me show. I break the world to my feet.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. That's a special type of person. I mean, there's not a whole lot of you.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, they are, though. They're more. They just don't know it.\n",
            "Speaker A: They just haven't.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. I don't look at myself as somebody special. These people just haven't been. They haven't been talking to the right person. That right person hasn't ignited their fucking ego.\n",
            "Speaker A: So they're just not far enough down the path of being that in whatever.\n",
            "Speaker B: They do, they haven't met them. They haven't met the right mentor. Yeah, because once you meet the right mentor, you don't want to be away from. You want to be in his presence always.\n",
            "Speaker A: Isn't that interesting? Like, how much inspiration you get from a mentor. Like, I had that with martial arts instructors when I was a kid. Like, my appreciation and my love for them was like, unsurpassed, you know, my admiration for them was unsurpassed. And for you to be a 13 year old kid and just all the pieces aligned. Not only did he have an amazing style that, like, he could teach you in a style that was like, uniquely effective for you, the way you fought, but he could hypnotize you.\n",
            "Speaker B: He affected my mind. Yeah, I didn't care if a guy was six, nine or 300 pounds. He affected my mind where I thought I was a superior than other people. And I was ordained by God to be this person. He has had my mind screwed up and there's no way I can lose. If I lose, it's because God is jealous. This particular night, it's just crazy.\n",
            "Speaker A: God is jealous. But Mike, here's what's crazy. He was right. He was right. You could say that he infected your mind, but he didn't. What he did is make you become that thing. He made you become that perfect version of what you could be in that, like, everything that you could have done at 20 years of age to be that elite, you did, you were as good as you could have been in that body. So he maximized your potential. He did it. I mean, you could say he messed with your mind, but he really didn't.\n",
            "Speaker B: But it was all about intention. Yes, all about intention. Fighting with intention, bad intention. Everything was bad intention.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's also so much technique, too, so much movement.\n",
            "Speaker B: It has to do with a lot. The belief system. Fighting a belief system is 90% of fighting.\n",
            "Speaker A: To have a guy that understands psychology so much and get you when you were so young, get you at twelve years of age and start coaching you and mentoring you.\n",
            "Speaker B: But at twelve, I wanted it bad too. I wanted it. It wasn't like somebody was forcing me. I said, I want to be champ. I want to be the boxing champ of the world.\n",
            "Speaker A: I'm sure Teddy Atlas said that when he would bring you to smokers when you were 13, kids wouldn't believe you were 13.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, listen.\n",
            "Speaker A: They'd get mad.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, stop lying. There was a gentleman named John Connor. He controlled the kid glove situation where you're 1213 14. And I had to. He banned me from. I'm from New York. But he said, no, you're from upstate. You can't fight here. But I'm born in Brooklyn. Cause the kids wouldn't go into the tournament. If I entered the tournament, nobody would enter. There'd see no fights. So I was banned from the tournament. They would ban me from tournaments. When I was a kid, listen, I was hitting these pork. These guys, they used to fight. I used to box some professional fighters. When I'm 13 and twelve, these guys, I'm hitting arms. These are mother and father. They try to sue the system. They say, he is not 1213 years old. There's no way. Listen, I'm 200 pounds. Solid 1213. I'm solid 200 pounds.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's incredible. Oh, my God. That is incredible. That's incredible.\n",
            "Speaker B: I've been fighting all my life. This is a little cat. I always had fights. It was. I had to be a fighter. If it wasn't a street fight, if it wasn't a professional fight, I would have been a street fighter. It's just I always got into fights.\n",
            "Speaker A: Who was the first person to ever show you how to throw a punch correctly?\n",
            "Speaker B: This guy named Wise. He had just came out of prison, but he used to be an amateur boxer. And I used to. I used to smoke weed. I'm like, nine, but I used to smoke weed and cigarettes. I smoked cigarettes before weed, but I'm smoking and I'm watching him shadow box. Well, I'm getting. I'm smoking weed around eight, and I'm watching this guy, nine.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: And I'm watching him shadow box. Wow. And I was impressed with that. And one day, this guy killed my bird, and I was fighting this guy, and I remember him skipping when he was shadowbox. And when I hit this guy, I started skipping. Everybody started to pull it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: Blew my mind. Even as a kid in the street, I started shit skipping. And everybody's, oh, shit, he's skipping. But I didn't know what I was doing. I was just copying what I saw. I didn't know I was skipping, but I was. I copied the guy, wise, and he was skipping. I thought that was part of fighting. I started skipping. Everybody started laughing and supporting.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow. So when you watched him shadow box, did you just copy it or did he show you? Did he give you pointers?\n",
            "Speaker B: No, I have that mind. Boom. Once I see it, boom, I got it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Mmm.\n",
            "Speaker B: I pick it up quick. Any of that. Look. Look at this. Weebly, soon as I pick it up, boom, I got interest. No, I don't say, once I got interested in something, I fucking destroy it.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: So it's always decimated. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. That's amazing. So that one dude, he was the first guy. Yeah, that was the first guy.\n",
            "Speaker B: You saw him skipping and moving and I'm smoking. I said, wow. I never thought. I never had a fight. I saw him do it. I said, wow.\n",
            "Speaker A: The movement is so interesting because everybody knows that head movement is important. Everybody knows that, like, Canelo has real good head movement. But there's only really been one heavyweight that had the kind of head movement like you did. Your head movement was fucking crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, that's when boxing is not fun, when you're getting hit in a lot, you know, I saw these guys hitting a lot, and later in life, they don't. Yeah, they're not functional later in life, I don't care how great they were. You can't. You can't beat the accumulation of punches. I don't see how great you are. It shows up later in life. And I was. I had a teacher that was just defense conscious. Customer was so defense conscious. He loved that his fighters were good looking and didn't have scars. Matter of fact, he loved when his fighters looked like me. If I wasn't, if you never saw me fight, you would never think I was a fighter. But looking at my face, no, no.\n",
            "Speaker A: You don't have any gash.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, my main objective was to hit and not be hit well.\n",
            "Speaker A: It was the style that peekaboo style and the bobbin and weaving so hard to hit, and you would punish people for mistakes. So it wasn't just that you were slipping a punch as you were slipping a punch, and a left hook from hell is coming right behind it, and there was so much movement and speed. It's like we've seen a bunch of different styles of heavyweights. But what's crazy is, from your rise to today, there's no one really who fights in your style. No, but which is kind of interesting, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't know. I just wanted to be somebody, and I wanted the greatest to know my name. I wanted a guy like Ali Duran to know who I was.\n",
            "Speaker A: You did that, my friend. You did that. The whole world knows your name. But what's interesting is that, like, your style was so effective, but there's not a heavyweight out there that fights like you, which is interesting, because that's a.\n",
            "Speaker B: Complicated style when you really think about it, because it's more like karate in boxing. Cause boxing, you're loose and karate is too. Move. That's like karate. You know, karate is.\n",
            "Speaker A: But your style was so terrifying, because instead of like a Larry Holmes style, where you're behind a strong jab and you're.\n",
            "Speaker B: That wasn't me.\n",
            "Speaker A: I'm short, right.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, my jab is only good when I'm a grandfather. It's not good when I'm out here.\n",
            "Speaker A: There were so many consequences. That was the thing about your fight. It's like every mistake that anybody made had grave consequences.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, the whole thing is you have to take risks, too. In order for fights to be exciting. People have to take risks. If a fight is, if you watch the two guys fighting, they're not taking risks. They're not fighting. Fighting is about taking risks.\n",
            "Speaker A: Exactly.\n",
            "Speaker B: Risking losing, getting hit.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's why the Tommy Hearns Marvin Hagler fight was so great, because they both threw caution to the win.\n",
            "Speaker B: Absolutely. But I. The fact that they both were getting.\n",
            "Speaker A: Hit, they were getting hit.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what made it exciting. But fighting's good when you're not getting hit and you're hitting the guy, right? That's when that's fighting.\n",
            "Speaker A: But what's fascinating to me is how effective you were. There's a part of the people forget how effective you were with your head movement. It was a big part of your style. You were so hard to hit. And when people were swinging at you, the counters were so dangerous.\n",
            "Speaker B: I just wanted to be the best, you know? That's just all I wanted to be. I didn't. I'm the kind of guy I'd rather, um, fucking win and get no fucking.\n",
            "Speaker A: Money, really, but because the feeling, winning, losing money.\n",
            "Speaker B: Fuck. He losing, fuck.\n",
            "Speaker A: Of course, when you really stop and think about what you were able to accomplish, it's pretty wild, man, because you, you changed boxing in a lot of ways. You made the heavyweight division exciting again. There was a long lull where people didn't appreciate Larry Holmes because he came after Ali. He's like the most underappreciated heavyweight of all time. What a fighter, what a fighter, what.\n",
            "Speaker B: A fighter, what a fighter.\n",
            "Speaker A: And he had the balls to balls to fight you.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, he had balls. In his prime. He had balls.\n",
            "Speaker A: Balls.\n",
            "Speaker B: He was nothing but balls.\n",
            "Speaker A: He was amazing. When, you know, you watch some of his fights, like Jerry Cooney knockout, God damn, he was good.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, after he fought me, he almost beat a van to hold the fit. And Oliver McCoy, 1.2 points from beating him. I said, God damn, I was so happy that I fought him. His first fight, Matt, it would have been different after he had ten or 15 other fights now. Cause he was good after.\n",
            "Speaker A: He did have a lot of good fights after that. As long as you were in jail, he'd keep fighting.\n",
            "Speaker B: Dirty dog.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's what he said, man. He's like, as long as Mike is not. Not around, I'll keep fighting. But fuck that.\n",
            "Speaker B: I really admire him and look up to him so much.\n",
            "Speaker A: My God, his jab.\n",
            "Speaker B: What? His nerve.\n",
            "Speaker A: Everything. His jab was a work of art. Larry Holmes had one of the greatest jabs ever.\n",
            "Speaker B: Exciting, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. No, he was. He was totally underappreciated because he came. Everybody was just so sad that he beat up Ali.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: You know, that's all.\n",
            "Speaker B: Ali had the effect on people. Like, unbelievable.\n",
            "Speaker A: Everybody loved Ali, so it was so hard to accept Larry Holmes after he beat up Ali in front of everybody. That's all. It was just. It was just the love of Ali. It's too bad, because if Ali didn't exist or if Larry Holmes didn't have to beat him to become a champion, if Ali had just retired and Larry Holmes came and fought somebody else and became the champ, people would appreciate how good he was.\n",
            "Speaker B: It wasn't meant to be. It wasn't written.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, wasn't written, but damn. And later in his life, when he's in his forties, he was having great boxing.\n",
            "Speaker B: Kicking ass. Looking good, man. Kicking. Talking shit. Talking shit.\n",
            "Speaker A: I guess he was like, fuck it. I could still do it.\n",
            "Speaker B: He was an athlete, huh?\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, we got credit by that for that. He's such an athlete.\n",
            "Speaker A: When you look at the heavyweight division today, it's. It's such a different landscape than back in your day.\n",
            "Speaker B: It could be a greater one, though. There's a lot of talent there that should be fighting one another. They can just keep fighting each other over and over. Let's keep all the top five guys just keep fighting each other. That's what, that's what it's about, is being active. They're not active enough. People don't see them enough. They hear about them, but they don't.\n",
            "Speaker A: Is it just that it's hard to get these fight scheduled? Is that. Is it? Are they just negotiating hard?\n",
            "Speaker B: Like, listen, when I was fighting, if I don't fight him, I'm not fighting, right? I'm not fighting nobody. This is who I want to fight. If I don't fight him, I'm not fighting nobody. You can take my belts.\n",
            "Speaker A: So it has to come to that.\n",
            "Speaker B: I want to fight him. If I don't fight him, I'm not fighting nobody. That's what he has to say. But they don't, you know. I don't know, but most people believe they lose their over. They don't know. It just began.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, some guys have been able to come back from, you know, rough losses and still gain the public's attention. Deontay is a perfect example.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's all about giving it your best.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: The reason why people don't appreciate you because you haven't gave your breath. This is what they look at. You made all this, is how cuss would look at it. You made all this money, you got all this fame, and this is how much you're going to give car. You're going to run only 5 miles, 4 miles. He gave you all his fame. Everybody know you only go give him five fucking miles. Right? Right. He cuts up, run that kind of gilling me. You know, you say, well, you know, God gave you all this. All this stuff he gave you. You can't. You can't give him five, five rounds, six rounds, eight rounds. You have to look at it from that perspective with all the times you have, and you just can't give it an extra round. You don't got another round in your mic. Give me a break, okay? You got 20 extra rounds. You go in your mind, wow.\n",
            "Speaker A: How important is that to hear too?\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, you need. For a guy like me with low self esteem and stuff like that, I need to hear that. I'm God. Yeah, you know, I don't hear that. Think that I'm, like, going to nowhere. You ain't gonna see me in no fight.\n",
            "Speaker A: Was the first time beating people in matches like as an amateur? Was that the first times where you felt really good about, like, accomplishments?\n",
            "Speaker B: Joe? All right, I'm gonna tell you something, and Teddy Atlas will tell you this. My first fight ever, right, I knocked the guy out and I stepped on him like this.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, my God.\n",
            "Speaker B: I was just so passionate about fighting. Boom. Knocked him out. I just got on a step. Don't like this.\n",
            "Speaker A: On my God.\n",
            "Speaker B: Daddy said, what the fuck? Listen, I'm really into that gangster warrior mentality, savage stuff.\n",
            "Speaker A: How old were you?\n",
            "Speaker B: I'm 13 or 1414, I think. And I knocked him out and I stepped on top. I'm on top of him. I got my feet on him like this. Teddy comes, Greg, what the hell you doing? Listen, I'm into that gank, that warrior mentality. I mean, since I was a kid, I'm stepping on people in the ring.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow.\n",
            "Speaker B: And I don't talk to people when I'm in the ring. People say, hey, you look good. The last fight, I just don't talk to them. People come up to me, great fight last night, and to never talk to nobody. People say, he's a weird asshole. No one likes me because I didn't talk to anybody before fighting. People said, great fight last night. Just look at him. Because this is what happened to me. One day a guy came up to me and said, great fight last night, you look good. I said, thank you very much, sir. And then Cus went like this, you know him? I said, no, he was just a nice guy. He was a nice guy. He came over here and said, congratulations for my fight last night. He said, what do you mean nice guy? Like you like him? He's, he's handsome like you. What do you mean, nice guys? Explain nice guy to me. And then my whole attitude changed. I don't know. He said, hi, cuss, I'm sorry. And then Cuss goes to the guy, hey, don't ever talk to my fighter again. Do you hear what I'm saying? Do you listen to me? Don't ever talk to my fighter again.\n",
            "Speaker A: Whoa.\n",
            "Speaker B: He was paranoid. Cause before he had fighters and people stole his fighters, so he thought everybody was gonna say that blew his mind. So he think all this fighters gonna leave him.\n",
            "Speaker A: Interesting.\n",
            "Speaker B: He had Rocky, Rocky, hammer, Rocky, Rocky. Ammo left him. That blew his mind. He thought everybody was going to steal his fighters. He just blew his mind about people. Still in fighters.\n",
            "Speaker A: That makes sense. That probably went on a lot.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Still in fighters.\n",
            "Speaker A: When you see the heavyweight division today, the Usyk versus Joshua match, that's a very interesting fight to me. That's very interesting. That Usyk guy is phenomenal.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, Tyson is going to have to wear him down. He can't because the guy's smoothing, moving all that stuff. Tyson is going to have to just wear him down. He's not going to box this guy. He's going to have to beat him down.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. Joshua's fighting Usyk next, and Tyson is fighting Dillian White.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, I think, I think, I think.\n",
            "Speaker A: They'Ve settled that, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: I think Dante Wallace should fight.\n",
            "Speaker A: That would be a great fight.\n",
            "Speaker B: That'd be good. Don't think he's gonna be aggressive trying to knock him out.\n",
            "Speaker A: He, listen, Deontay Wilder can knock anybody out. His power is ridiculous. When he knocked out Ortiz.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, that was beautiful.\n",
            "Speaker A: That was crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: But listen, having a hard punch is like having a nuclear war, but it don't serve no military value if it doesn't land on its target. Right. Usyk is very hard to hit.\n",
            "Speaker A: Very hard to hit very hard. Joshua did catch him a couple times, though.\n",
            "Speaker B: I know, but Joshua, Joshua is elite. Usyk is an elite amateur boxer. He has that amateur boxing stuff. Mess guys like Joshua cause there's too much movement, thinking and all that stuff. And he's not really an amateur. He's just, he got so much, he could do so much. That's why he's never a lost soul. He can learn so much. He's still learning. That's why he stays, Josh, because he still fucking learned.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, he definitely made an adjustment after the Andy Ruiz fight, right? He lost to Ruiz the first fight, come back, won a clear unanimous decision.\n",
            "Speaker B: In the second fight with other gentlemen too.\n",
            "Speaker A: Andy Ruiz, yeah, yeah, Andy Ruiz. Yeah. I think, I'm fascinated to see how that fight goes down. Is that delayed because of the war? Is there?\n",
            "Speaker B: Like, I think it was because Joshua has to know how to do more. Boom. We got boom, boom. Jab gotta be like, he can't think. Jab has got constantly be out there. And he got turned it into something.\n",
            "Speaker A: That's the thing about Usyk having. He used to be a cruiserweight. He's got a lot of. A lot of endurance. Like, he doesn't, doesn't move like a big guy, moves like a smaller guy.\n",
            "Speaker B: His Joshua. Joshua needs to pick up the pace a little. Just a little. Not much. It's a pickup. He doesn't. He is guy. He. He has got so much damn potential.\n",
            "Speaker A: He definitely does. But he, he comes back from every fight that he's had better, you know, I mean, when he, one of the most impressive ones was he knocked out Klitschko.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, my God. Seen the team better days, though. He great than true.\n",
            "Speaker A: But Klitschko dropped him first and he came back and stopped him.\n",
            "Speaker B: That was a wild fight too.\n",
            "Speaker A: That was a wild fight. Yeah, it's. It's a great heavyweight time right now.\n",
            "Speaker B: Joshua's no walkover right now. It's just that for some reason, I don't know, we expect a lot from Joshua for some reason. I guess maybe because english people are so behind that. We got caught up in the bandwagon too. But Americans specked a lot out of Joshua. For some reason.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, he's an Adonis. He's like a perfect specimen.\n",
            "Speaker B: Oh, after boxing powers, he's gonna have a beautiful life after boxing.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, he's beautiful, but his power is stunning. He has crazy power and he's a. He's just an elite athlete. The Tyson Fury fight, to me, that's a real interesting one. Those two guys, that's a real interesting fight to me, you know, because Tyson Fury is so unusual. He's so tall and long and his movement. I mean, he's got such a nice jab and he's so good at like, using distance and clinching.\n",
            "Speaker B: It's just weird to take him serious. Cause he's fucking really. He doesn't take the fight. He's laughing at me, licking their blood. What's wrong with this guy?\n",
            "Speaker A: But Mike doesn't take a certain amount of crazy.\n",
            "Speaker B: You gotta be out of your toe. You gotta totally be out of your mind.\n",
            "Speaker A: And that's what he is, right? He's out of his fucking mind.\n",
            "Speaker B: Totally out of your mind. Listen, nobody picked this up. What fighter comes in the ring with Patsy Klein? Crazy, unless he's losing and he trying to tell you I'm losing my mind. He's trying to let the people know I'm fucking losing my mind. I'm crazy. This heavyweight championship's not the way I thought it was. This is insanity.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: The heavyweight champion's insanity, man. It's called the crown of thorns, baby. Everybody that wore that title got a story to tell. They have a story to tell, baby.\n",
            "Speaker A: He's in the middle of his story right now. Those wilder fights are incredible.\n",
            "Speaker B: You know, it's just weird how, you know, if we, if certain people were living in biblical time, they would be prophets like he would. If he was in biblical times, he would be a prophet and stuff. They couldn't explain that. Why is he so successful in that particular.\n",
            "Speaker A: They can't explain why is he exceptional?\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. They couldn't explain Goliath or Samson. They just couldn't understand these guys. Listen, David's known for the father of Israel. He created Israel, right? What's the only thing you know David for? What is he known for? He created the whole nation. But what is he known for?\n",
            "Speaker A: Killing Goliath.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes. He's done so many great things. The only thing he's known for, if you're not a scholar, really, the only thing you know David for is killing Goliath. A fight? Yeah, he's known for a fight. He made a. He created a whole nation, but he's known for a fight. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: He killed a big guy with a rock.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. Slingshot. Then he chopped his head off.\n",

            "Speaker A: There's always, throughout history, there's been the best fighter and they were one of the most revered people in society till today, too. Today, there's a thing about a heavyweight title fight where you know, whether it's an mma or it's in boxing, you know, that is the elite of the elite. As far as fighting, it's as good as people are alive.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, in 2020, someone told me that they say you could be, you could work in TeslA, the head corporation in TeslA, all your high tech geeks, right? If a fight goes down in the lobby, the whole place left the room, they're watching the fight. It's just, that's what fight does, is the animal instincts in the. Yeah, somebody never had a fight in their life. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Never had a fight. Yeah. Get em. Get em.\n",
            "Speaker A: Especially if you're watching two people argue, and then it escalates, and then, you know, the fists are gonna fly, isn't it? How funny is it to you to watch people who have no idea how to fight and they're willing to get into fights? Isn't that crazy?\n",
            "Speaker B: That's just the lack of self control. It's all about. Cause you have no idea how much pain you're gonna be in in a FeW minutes. You have no idea till that pain happens to really start to increase. And you say, what the hell happened?\n",
            "Speaker A: When you see those videos of people who DOn't know how to fight, and they pick a fight with someone who's a trained fighter, and they get knocked out, and you realize, like, what a horrible mistake it was for that person to do that.\n",

            "Speaker A: I think.\n",
            "Speaker B: Not all the time. You can do that, but certain times, you see, this guy's not in my league. Don't hurt him unless your ego's flaring up and you want to stop this guy in front of a lot of people.\n",
            "Speaker A: A lot of guys do want to stop a guy. I mean, someone's trying to hurt you, all right, but listen, it's hard to pull back.\n",
            "Speaker B: Listen, that's just your intent. You believe he's trying to hurt you, maybe he's really not. And you kill him by accident. That happened so many times.\n",

            "Speaker B: I was locked. Listen, I was locked up with a guy. He never hit nobody in his life, but this guy owed the money, so most of the guys, he said, so he shot the guy in the foot. The guy died.\n",

Like, why would you want to hallucinate? Why would you want to lose? They think it's something negative. Cause you think of a drug that's that powerful, you think of it as having a negative consequence. But I think it's probably just really effective and it should be managed. They should figure out, like, what is the dose if you weigh 100 pounds? What is the dose if you weigh 150 pounds? Is there a way to do this in, like, a clinical setting where people can go and experience something? Yeah, but I'm not gonna kill them.\n",

            "Speaker A: Yeah. Shrooms are a very strange thing because it's a life form, whatever it is. It's some sort of a weird life form that breathes oxygen. Mushrooms breathe oxygen, like we do.\n",

            "Speaker B: I found that out. No, listen. As I was saying before, we don't know who the hell we are. So if it's rain, we're made out of rain. Then we're made out of diamonds, too. We're made out of gold. No. Really?\n",

            "Speaker B: It's this way of dying. I was just looking at my 13 year old daughter. That's just a genius. And it's a form of dying where you prepare for dying and you turn into the fungus process, and you prepare. I forgot what they call it, but you prepare for dying, you stop eating, and your body slows down.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: And the fungus starts to process before you even start dying.\n",

            "Speaker B: Buddha's pretty interesting. Buddha believed that suffering was self suffering, and God didn't create us to suffer, and that's what he lived for, to stop self suffering. I was looking on the story, like, a month ago, and I thought that was pretty interesting. I never, I never understood that he was very wealthy and he left all of that and his wife and his children. Stop suffering. Self suffering. Really? Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, that. Those guys, man, the. The idea of starving yourself and turning yourself into a mummy, that wasn't uncommon. They would do that. That was a real thing they did. There was one guy that got turned into a statue. Did you ever see that?\n",
            "Speaker B: No.\n",
            "Speaker A: They studied the statue of a monk that was in a lotus position, and then they did an x ray of it, and they found out there's a skeleton inside the statue, covered it. Yeah, yeah. So they made a statue out of this monk, who they think probably, oh, look at this. Mummified monk in Mongolia. Not dead. Said Buddhist. Oh, this is a different one. They say he's not dead. They're like, hang on. Don't call it yet. He's gonna make a comeback. Oh. They said he's in a deep meditative trance and not dead. Forensic examinations are underway on the remains.\n",

            "Speaker B: I think death got a bad rap.\n",
            "Speaker A: Death has a bad rap. Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: I think we should be afraid of death, but we shouldn't cling to life. You know, we should have. We should, um, be appreciative of the time that we had here that was successful and the way that we evolved and just call it a day and.\n",
            "Speaker A: Experience as much fun and as much happiness as you can while you're here.\n",

            "Speaker A: You gotta suffer.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. So let's stop. Just to always remember that life is not happiness. Doesn't mean. Hehehe. Happiness is adversity.\n",
            "Speaker A: Overcoming adversity challenges difficult things. I went to Alaska once.\n",
            "Speaker B: I wanted to go there.\n",
            "Speaker A: I've been a few times, but I went this one time. We went to Prince Edward's island. It rains constantly. Constantly. I mean, we were camping, and it was raining while we were camping, so you never get dry. You're just constantly wet.\n",
            "Speaker B: Tell me about the bears.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, that was a place that didn't have big bears. They only had a few black bears. We didn't see any bears. We were looking for deer. We didn't get a deer. But we were up there camping in the rain. And then I came back to California, and I remember I called all my friends. I go, dude, I've never been happier in my life because I was drenched. I was just drenched for, like, nine days or seven days or whatever we were. But when we came back, it was just sunny, and so it was. I never felt better about the sun. It felt so good.\n",
            "Speaker B: You were talking about the deer just now?\n",
            "Speaker A: Mm hmm.\n",
            "Speaker B: I used to be a cold blooded vegan until I met you and the venison and the bison and all that stuff. And then I realized that your body needs that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Your body, if you're gonna be a high level performance athlete.\n",
            "Speaker B: I never eaten that.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's very likely that it could benefit from some animal protein.\n",
            "Speaker B: I've never eaten bison. Another venison. I've never eaten that in my life. I even go to the bathroom better.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think it's the best food you can eat.\n",
            "Speaker B: I'm always strong. No matter what I'm taking, what I'm doing, I'm always strong. No matter if I'm on diet, I'm not eating anything, but just that. Yeah. And blueberries feel incredible.\n",
            "Speaker A: I think bison is, like, a perfect food.\n",
            "Speaker B: I believe that, too.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's perfect.\n",
            "Speaker B: I really believe it. Just, I don't get no after effects like I do from chicken or something.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right? Yeah. If you get organic bison, man, that is some amazing meat. It's so good for it. So rich in protein, too. So is like, deer and moose and elk and all those different animals.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's what I've been eating lately.\n",
            "Speaker A: So much better for you.\n",
            "Speaker B: I never knew about that stuff till I met you.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, I'm glad you got into it. And it's the only problem with that is, like, you can't have a reliable amount of that stuff farmed.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, I always have. In the, frozen. In the freezer.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: I have a whole freezer with bison, Venice. I ordered oak elk. It's a freezer one free.\n",
            "Speaker A: Wow, that's awesome. It's the best meat, I think.\n",
            "Speaker B: I don't even look at it as red meat. I don't look at it. I don't look at it. Red meat. I don't feel like I'm eating red meat.\n",
            "Speaker A: Well, it's game, you know, it's like what it is, is like an animal that is evolved to get away from the scariest predators. It's an animal in North America that's evolved to get away from mountain lions and wolves and grizzly bears. That's what it's evolved to get away from. And now, people, that's a amazing animal. And when you. The nutrients in it, it's so dense. Like, it just. It feels better when it is.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. It's so much superior than any food, any meat I've ate before.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah, it's, um. It's fucking good for you.\n",
            "Speaker B: Well, thank you. I appreciate that.\n",
            "Speaker A: Mike Tyson. You're a bad motherfucker.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yes. Don't think you know you sometimes since I took the toad, right. I thought I knew so much. And then you do DMT and you realize you know shit. Just don't know anything.\n",
            "Speaker A: I was just reading an article about that. These vets that were talking about their experience on that same stuff on five Meo DMT. And then these trips that they were having, how it would help them put things into perspective because it's just so potent.\n",
            "Speaker B: Some of the things that, you know, after doing the toad and some of the things that I thought I've done in the past, I. Look, I said, who is that person?\n",
            "Speaker A: Right?\n",
            "Speaker B: What was that nonsense coming out? It's just a different thing. It's just I can't articulate it.\n",
            "Speaker A: It's probably what created people, Mike. It's probably what created the ethical framework that made societies. It probably was tripping. Probably like group tripping. And then, of course, like love of family and love of friends and love of your companions and the people.\n",
            "Speaker B: That's all that DMT is about. It hits the love gland.\n",
            "Speaker A: Oh, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: It penetrates the love gland and it just over exaggerates it.\n",
            "Speaker A: And if you could feel good, if you can relax when you're on a DMT trip, it's like the most loving experience. If you could just relax. But a lot of heart. Yeah. Oh, my God. So much beauty. Like you can't believe.\n",
            "Speaker B: No, someone else said this. I said, I said, coming back as a downer when she did the toad. And you come back. Oh, God.\n",
            "Speaker A: I know. It's like regular life seems kind of dull.\n",
            "Speaker B: It is. The minds taking you so many places.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. I wonder if that's what happens when you die. That's what I'm. That's what I worry or wonder most about.\n",
            "Speaker B: This is what they found out right. The soul. We want what the soul weigh. 20 1 gram. The 2.1 gram, something like that.\n",
            "Speaker A: That was a movie, right?\n",
            "Speaker B: No, no.\n",
            "Speaker A: About when people died that their life wasn't a movie. No, no, it wasn't nobody. But it also was a movie showed.\n",
            "Speaker B: Where the person was on the way before he died. On the scale? Yeah. As soon as he died, he was 2.1 gram or 21 grams lighter. How much is it again, brother?\n",
            "Speaker C: 21.\n",
            "Speaker A: 21 grams. It was a. There was a movie about people dying and about. Who was that? It was a popular movie.\n",
            "Speaker C: Yeah, I think. Ethan Hawke.\n",

            "Speaker C: Sean Penn.\n",
            "Speaker A: It was about that jump in.\n",
            "Speaker C: Naomi Watts. Beniso del Toro.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah. So is that. That is real. Like, you're acting by time.\n",
            "Speaker B: They did the light at 21 grams or 2.1 gram. Something that affect.\n",
            "Speaker A: I wonder how they measure that. Like, when do they know?\n",
            "Speaker B: They put him on why he's alive. He's only right before he died. They weigh him while he's dying.\n",
            "Speaker A: So you let him die on a scale?\n",
            "Speaker B: No, it's like. Yeah, it's a long skill.\n",
            "Speaker A: Right? Right. Oh, so you turn the bed into a scale.\n",
            "Speaker B: Pretty much.\n",
            "Speaker A: You could probably do that. That seems like you should be able to do that.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah. And when they die, they notice that the skill is lighter. Whoa. 21 grams. I don't know. How do you. How can you measure 21 grams? I'm sure you do.\n",
            "Speaker A: Your spirit actually has a weight.\n",
            "Speaker B: Because imagine 21 grams making all this function. 21 grams. Got this guy over the computer reading, telling us that 21 grams is 21 grams.\n",
            "Speaker A: Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker B: So imagine how much power that 20 1 gram. Gram have. If it doesn't, if it's missing as soon as you die.\n",
            "Speaker A: Is that real?\n",
            "Speaker C: So it comes from an experiment a guy did in 1907.\n",
            "Speaker B: God damn.\n",
            "Speaker A: Somebody might want to run that one back.\n",
            "Speaker B: Yeah, we need to try that one.\n",
            "Speaker A: Again, because if he's a liar, we got a problem. Cause if he's right, though, it's amazing. If he's right. And then I want him to be. That's the problem. Like, I want him to be right.\n",
            "Speaker C: 2001, physicist Lewis Hollander published an article in the Journal of Scientific Exploration where he exhibited the results of a similar experiment. Tested the weight of one ram seven. Use three lambs, one goat at the.\n",
            "Speaker B: Moment with animals as well.\n",
            "Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah, we didn't say that again. So. So he did it with their bodies. Upon death, they lost weight.\n",
            "Speaker C: His experiment showed that seven of the adult sheep varied their weight upon dying, though not losing it, but rather gaining an amount.\n",

You have to be able to write poetry. He felt like if you had any imbalance, like, if you were, like, too aggressive or too peaceful, like, any imbalance was dangerous. He's like, you had to be, like, perfectly centered. So you had to be a person who understood all things.\n",
            " Mike Tyson: That's true. But everybody can't express themselves being centered. People have to be totally insane to express themselves or totally introverted to express themselves. And I don't know why it's like that.\n",

Do you understand the kind of self control it would take to be the baddest man on the planet? And you're only 20.\n",

Do better tomorrow. That was bad. Okay, I gotta move my head. I got hit today. I got a black guy. Oh, God. Custer's gonna be mad at me if he see me do this, if he see me get hit. It was just.

I mean, you obviously were the greatest, but there's like, almost like a samurai way of looking at it, where you acknowledge it, but you don't think about it, you know? And I don't know. I don't know who the fuck is capable of doing that. No one's capable of doing that at 20.\n",

People are afraid because you think about the early times when you were learning something, you're fucking terrible. At it. There's nothing more terrifying than being terrible at fighting. And you're learning fighting around people that are really good at it. And if you enter into that relic, you have to be a really courageous person to be a beginner in fighting.\n",

Yeah, it's totally, if they don't pick it up quickly, you know, we lose our interest because they think it should be like us or they should be that dedicated like us.

A disastrous two year war ended in 1996, but russian forces returned to the region just three years later after russian authorities blamed Chechens for a series of bombings in Russia. Wow. Okay. So it was a 57 hours standoff at this palace of cultures, during which two hostages were killed. Russian special forces surrounded and raided the theater on the morning of October 26. Later, it was revealed that they had pumped a powerful narcotic gas into the building, knocking nearly all of the terrorists and hostages unconscious before breaking into the walls and roof and entering through underground sewage tubs.

So he was a scholar and he was also an ordained minister, but he became agnostic after he started reading all this biblical literature and stuff and realizing that a lot of these stories come from older and older stories. So he reads this thing for 14 years and decodes it, and he comes up with this theory that Christianity was really based around psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults.

And he thinks it all came from the consumption these psychedelic mushrooms. And this guy was a straight, like, academic. He wasn't a crazy person.
